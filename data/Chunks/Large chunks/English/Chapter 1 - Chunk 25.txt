Everyday Working Habits. Good everyday working habits are vital to the health of your computer. Mea­sures such as using dust covers, an antistatic mat, and a surge protector can go a long way in preventing system problems. Using Dust Covers. Buy dust covers to protect the monitor, system unit/key­ board, disk drive, and printer. Dirt and moisture are your system's worst enemies. Contacts - the exposed wires, or legs, of the integrated circuit (IC) chips on the system's printed circuit boards-have electric current flowing through them, which can attract particles of dust. The dust, in turn attracts moisture out of the air. As this process continues, the dust and moisture eventually cause electrical shorts and corrosion of the electronic parts, which can then cause system mal­functions.
