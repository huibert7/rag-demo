A second type of memory is also provided as part of the CPU, called read-only memory (ROM). ROM chips have programs permanently stored in its memory which is retained whether or not the computer system has power. When the system is turned on, the program can be invoked immediately, without having to load it from an outside storage device. Data cannot be written to ROM chips by the user; they are preprogrammed and can only be read, hence the name. In the Apple II systems, BASIC is permanently stored in ROM. Basic input/output functions are also handled in the ROM chips. In addition, some Apple II systems have a machine language monitor in ROM.
