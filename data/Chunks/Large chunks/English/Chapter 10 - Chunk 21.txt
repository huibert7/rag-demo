Module Testing. There is no such thing as a perfect, bug-free program, no matter how experi­enced and talented the programmer is. Just as there might have been problems while programming the module, there will probably be problems after the pro­gram is completely written. These bugs might manifest themselves by the pro­gram simply not working, the program crashing when trying to perform a certain function, the program doing something other than what is expected, or it might be something as simple as a display not looking quite right on the screen. Because of these bugs, the module testing phase is extremely important and necessary. Test the new device diagnostic module thoroughly as a standalone program before integrating it with the System Diagnostic Program. Try out each and every function possible. Wherever different values are to be input by the user, try every different value and combination imaginable. Particularly use extreme values, such as very high values and very low values, and make sure the program can accommodate these inputs without breaking down. Also find out how the program handles the input of incorrect values and conditions.
