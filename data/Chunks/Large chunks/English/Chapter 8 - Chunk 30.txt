Problem: Printer Does Not Work. If the serial communication interface connects with a printer, make sure that the printer's internal switches are set up to your configuration. Most printers can communicate using either a serial or parallel interface. Solutions: Printers ordinarily default to the parallel interface, and a switch must be set in order to use the serial communication line. Refer to the printer documen­tation. The printer also needs to know the usual communication parameters, such as the baud rate being run, character length, parity, and so forth. This is set up with a DIP-switch on the printer interface board. The printer documenta­tion details how to make the necessary settings.
