Disk Drive Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines. Disk drive problems can be caused by the diskette, the disk drive controller board, the disk drive, or the motherboard. When you troubleshoot any disk drive problem, check for diskette problems first. If the diskette is good, then check the disk drive controller. If the controller is functioning normally, troubleshoot the disk drive itself. If the disk drive is operational, finally troubleshoot the mother­board. If your troubleshooting efforts point to a problem in the disk drive controller board, make sure it is seated properly in the correct expansion slot, and see that the contacts are clean. If you find a problem in the disk drive, take it in for servicing. The disk drive can require many precision adjustments that should be performed only by com­puter repair professionals. If a disk drive problem is caused by the motherboard, refer to Chapter 3 for system unit troubleshooting procedures.
