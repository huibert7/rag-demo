Problem: Printer Needs to Be Serviced. If the solutions described above fail to solve your printer problem, write down every symptom of the problem. Also indicate what you have already checked and the results. Then call your Apple II service center and talk to a technician. Describe the type of printer and computer you have, and the problem it is experiencing. Explain what you have already tried to do to find and fix the problem, and indicate the results, based on your notes. Find out if there are any solutions they can suggest over the phone. If the technician cannot suggest any further solutions over the phone, ask whether you should bring in just the printer, or include other parts of the com­puter system as well. Find out if the technician has any ideas yet on what the problem might be, and how long and how much it might cost to fix. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before you pay for and accept your printer, have the repair technician demon­strate that the problem has actually been fixed. Then pack the printer up and take it home. Connect everything together, and refer to Chapter 9, "The Exerciser," for instructions on burning in the system after repair. The Exerciser includes several tests for the printer which can be run continuously.
