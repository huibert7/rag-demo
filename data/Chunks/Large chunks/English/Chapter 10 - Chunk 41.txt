Writing the Game Paddle Diagnostic Module. After the flowchart has been thoroughly developed and diagrammed, the actual diagnostic code can be written. Again, refer to the BASIC programming reference books. Refer to the Appendix to see examples of how the other diagnosÂ­tic modules have performed certain activities. Research and experiment with any special commands, instructions, formats, or other idiosyncrasies about programming the game paddle on the Apple II. Save and try out each program segment while you work, to make sure everything is proceeding smoothly. The Game Paddle Diagnostic Module Listing. Based on the flowchart, the program code might look similar (although it could have many variations) to the listing shown in Fig. 10-11.
