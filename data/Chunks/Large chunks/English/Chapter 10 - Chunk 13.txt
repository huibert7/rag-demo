The diamond-shaped decision symbol represents a place within the program at which the computer must make a decision based on logic/comparison opera­tions, also performed by the computer. Exit paths from the decision symbol are usually determined by a yes or no answer to a conditional statement written in the form of a question. If the computer results indicate a yes, the program branches in one direction. If the results indicate a no, the program branches in another direction. The round connector symbol is used when additional flow lines might cause confusion and reduce rather than enhance understanding of the program flow. It is usually identified with a number or letter, and connects with a matching connector symbol by the same number or letter indicated elsewhere in the flow­ chart. Arrows connect the various flowcharting symbols together to indicate the direction (or any change of direction) in which a program or segment of a program will flow (Fig. 10-2).
