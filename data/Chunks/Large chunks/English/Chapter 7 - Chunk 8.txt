Disk Drive Controller. The disk drive connects to the computer system unit and is operated by means of the disk interface controller (Fig. 7-4). The disk drive and controller are optional on the II Plus and IIe. The disk drive is external, and conventionally its controller board is installed in expansion slot #6 on the motherboard. An internal disk drive and controller are standard on the Apple IIc. The disk drive is built into the IIc system unit, and the disk drive controller consists of a single chip on the motherboard (Fig. 7-5). A connector for a second external drive is found at the rear of the IIc system unit. Each disk drive controller has connectors for two disk drives. This means that for every disk drive controller the system contains, it can control two drives, designated as D1 and D2. An Apple II system can support a maximum of three disk drive controllers for a total of six disk drives (Fig. 7-6). The disk drive controller instructs the disk drive when and how to read and write information, as directed by the CPU and software commands.
