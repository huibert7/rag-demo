Start Bits and Stop Bits. In serial communication, the software generates additional bits to each character to help coordinate the communication transfer. These added bits are referred to as start bits and stop bits. When the software adds both the start bit and stop bit, then ten bits are actually sent for each data character. The start bit signals the beginning of a character, and flags the attention of the receiving device. It in essence informs the device to expect seven or eight more bits of data for processing. Likewise, the stop bit signifies the end of a character. Both the transmitter and receiver in the communication line need to know whether start bits and stop bits are being employed (Fig. 8-6).
