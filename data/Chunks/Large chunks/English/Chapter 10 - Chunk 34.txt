Problem: Game Paddle Does Not Move the Object Properly. The game paddle should be able to move its object all the way to the left and to the right of the screen in a given application. If the game paddle is unable to move the object in this manner, or if the object shakes or moves with difficulty, then you have a problem with the control wheel potentiometer. Solutions: Check the cable connection and make sure the game paddle connection is properly plugged into its port. Following instructions found in the game paddle user guide, carefully disasÂ­semble the game paddle. Spray contact cleaner onto the potentiometer. Swap another game paddle onto the system, if available. If the other game paddle works on the system, then your game paddle is defective, and should be replaced. If the other game paddle does not work, then you have a problem with the system unit. Refer to Chapter 3 for further solutions.
