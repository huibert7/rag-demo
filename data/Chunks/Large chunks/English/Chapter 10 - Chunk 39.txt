The Fire Test. A second test necessary for game paddle diagnostics is to test the fire button. When the fire button is pressed, the routine PEEKs into the appropriÂ­ate game paddle memory location to check for a value greater than 127. The game paddle memory location for port 0, as labeled on the motherboard, is -16287. For port 1, the location is - 16286. For port 2, the location is -16285. (Due to inherent Apple II restrictions, the fire button for port 3 cannot be tested.) A value greater than 127 residing in the game paddle memory location indicates that the fire button has been pressed. The Fire Test can serve two purposes: to test the fire button, and to quit from the current Game Paddle port test. After you press the fire button, the Game Paddle Diagnostic menu will be displayed. At this point, you can test the game paddle on another port. If the fire button does not cause the Game Paddle Diagnostic menu to display, then the fire button is probably defective. Pressing CTRL C kills the program and exits to the Applesoft BASIC environment. Refer to "Problem: The Fire Button Does Not Work" above to troubleshoot and repair the fire button. Then run the test again.
