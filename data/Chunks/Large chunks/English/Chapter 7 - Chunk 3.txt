Description and Function of the Disk Drive. A disk drive provides a means for high-speed storage and retrieval for programs and data, and as such, it is one of the most useful peripheral devices for the Apple II (Fig. 7-1). Spreadsheet software, database programs, and word processing applications can be quickly stored and accessed using a disk drive. The disk drive can also store the data on which these programs operate: the numbers and table data in a spreadsheet, the field and record data in a database, and the words in a word processing file. The terms disk, diskette, disk drive, and drive are used in this chapter. Disk is the general term for the floppy disk media on which the data is written. Diskette also refers to the floppy diskette media. Disk drive and drive are both generic terms for the floppy disk drive.
