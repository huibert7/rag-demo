The Game Port Option. First of all, because the Apple II includes four game paddle ports, the diagnostic user instructions should include a prompt for which port is to be tested. This will allow discrete testing of all four ports. The four ports are designated as 0, 1 , 2, and 3 (Fig. 10-8). The Tracking Test. The game paddle includes a potentiometer which deterÂ­mines the direction of movement for the object it is controlling. Because of this, one particularly useful test would be an on-screen display tracking the direction to which the game paddle is pointing. This would let you diagnose whether or not the potentiometer is tracking properly. Such a test would display a tracking gauge with a block indicating where the game paddle wheel is positioned along its rotational range. When you rotate the game paddle toward the left, the block pointer tracks along the gauge to indicate the wheel's movement and direction (Fig. l0-9). Likewise, when you rotate the game paddle toward the right, the block tracks toward the right along the gauge. The far right and far left positions on the gauge match up to the game paddle's far right and left extremes.
