Apple II user groups are excellent repositories of information and experience. You can find a local user group through your computer dealer, in the newspaper's computer or social events section, or from listings in computer magazines. The people you'll meet at a user group can help answer questions, solve problems, and find other resources. Read the Apple II computer magazines such as: A+ (Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, Ziff Communications Company, One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016).  NIBBLE (Micro SPARK , Inc., 52 Domino Drive, Concord, MA 01742). inCider (IDG Communications/Peterborough, Inc., 80 Elm Street, PeterÂ­borough, NH 03458).
