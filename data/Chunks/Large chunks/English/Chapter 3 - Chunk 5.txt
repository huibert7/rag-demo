Control Section. Every computer program instruction consists of at least two parts. The first part of the instruction indicates the command. The second part of the instruction indicates the address which locates the data to be acted upon by the command. The control section of the CPU interprets these program instruc­tions, and then executes them. The control section works closely with the arith­metic-logic section to perform the necessary calculations or comparisons to carry it out.
