Problem: Communication Cannot Be Established. The inability to establish communication might manifest itself in the inability to dial up, to make the connection after dialing, or to detect the carrier after connecting. Solutions: Check that all connections are properly made and firmly seated. There are three interface connections: the interface board's ribbon cable connection on the board, the RS-232 cable connection to the ribbon cable, and the RS-232 cable connection to the communication device. Run the Serial Communication Diagnostic module (described in the followÂ­ ing section of this chapter). If the test fails, and the character entered is not echoed on the screen, try the test using another RS-232 cable. Swap your serial communication interface board with another Apple II system (with the Apple IIe, this means swapping the entire motherboard). If communications can be established with your board on the other system, the problem is with the serial communication port on your Apple II. Refer to "Problem: Oxidation Needs to be Removed" in Chapter 3, for instructions on cleaning the edge connector. If the board still cannot establish communications on the other system, the problem lies in the modem itself. Take the modem in for repair.
