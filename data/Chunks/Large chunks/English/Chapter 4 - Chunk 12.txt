Problem: An Individual Key Does Not Work. If after pressing a character key, its character does not display on the screen, then that key might have a problem. If you press a function key, but it does not perform its specified function, that key might be defective as well. For one of several reasons, the key's ASCII code is not getting to the CPU for processing. Try the following solution. Solution: Use a key extractor to lift the key from the keyboard (Fig. 4-3). Then lightly spray contact cleaner on the key post (Fig. 4-4). Contact cleaner is available at electronics stores. Replace the keycap on the post and try it again. If the key still does not work, the keyboard's contact switch might be damaged. Take the unit in for servicing.
