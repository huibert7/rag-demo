System Unit Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines. This section describes the problems that the system unit could experience, what causes these problems, and details the steps needed to be taken to fix them. After reading subsequent chapters covering troubleshooting procedures for each of the subsystems, it will become evident that if initially nothing happens, the system unit is the suspect component to troubleshoot. And, if you try all the troubleshooting suggestions for a particular subsystem, but still cannot find the problem, then again it is probably the system unit. You will be directed back to this section to find and repair the system unit problem. Although there is no specific system unit module within the System Diagnostic Program, the modules testing each of the subsystems perform a sufficient job of exercising the system as a whole. This is because all subsystems are connected into and controlled by the system unit.
