The Main Menu. Once the program is loaded, the screen displays the System Diagnostic Main Menu. This menu presents several diagnostic options, as shown in Fig. 2-2. A selection is made by pressing the one-character command representing the first letter of the name of the desired test. For example, if you wish to run the keyboard test, enter a K or k. The program is not character case-sensitive, but the Apple II Plus can only use the uppercase values. When you press a valid selection, the screen clears and presents either a new menu or begins the desired test immediately. If an invalid command such as a Z or R is entered, the system beeps and returns to the selection mode to let you try again. When you press Q, the program "quits," or ceases operation, and returns the computer to the Applesoft BASIC environment.
