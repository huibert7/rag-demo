Note: If desired, the Ile can be reconfigured as a "Dvorak keyboard," an alternative keyboard layout often preferred for high-speed typing. If you wish to switch to the Dvorak layout, refer to the Ile user manual or technical reference manual for instructions. Even though a mouse, joystick, game paddle, and digitizer pad are available, the keyboard is the Apple II system's primary input device.
