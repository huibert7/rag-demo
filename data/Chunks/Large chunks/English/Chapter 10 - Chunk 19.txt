Begin the line numbers around 6000, or wherever the System Diagnostic Program ended, so that subsequent integration into the System Diagnostic Pro­ gram will be easier. This will eliminate the need for renumbering the program upon integration, which is a very tedious process, and could cause more prob­lems. Refer to the code of existing modules as listed in the individual chapters or in the Appendices, to familiarize yourself with the techniques used in coding those modules. It might be necessary to stop several times throughout the coding process to do further research. Find out which BASIC commands perform a particular func­tion, what the syntax of that command is, as well as what kinds of parameters the command includes. The Applesoft BASIC manual and device documentation are the best resources for this information. They also provide examples. Try these examples to get a feel for how the command works. When convinced that this is the proper command to use for this application, include it with the necessary parameters and variables in your device diagnostic program.
