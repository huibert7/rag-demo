Some printers print only left to right, and are called unidirectional printers. Others can print both left to right and right to left, and are called bidirectional printers. They put characters on a page much faster, since no time is wasted in sending the print head back to the beginning of a new line. Many dot matrix printers offer several qualities of print, including draft, nearÂ­ letter-quality, and letter-quality modes. The draft mode might print a minimum number of dots for a character, thus taking the least amount of time. The other modes use multiple print passes and additional dots to make a darker, more solid-looking character with better resolution. The tradeoff for higher quality printing is speed.
