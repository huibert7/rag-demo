The Central Processing Unit. The central processing unit (CPU) consists of three sections: Arithmetic-logic. General control. Storage. The CPU, located on the motherboard, is made up of several integrated circuit (IC) chips: the microprocessor chip and system memory chips (Fig. 3-2). The microprocessor performs the arithmetic-logic and general control CPU func­tions. The memory chips perform system data storage functions. The Apple II Plus uses the 6502 microprocessor chip as part of its CPU; the IIe uses the 6502B; and the 65C02 microprocessor controls the IIc. These chips perform the arithmetic-logic and control functions for their respective com­puters.
