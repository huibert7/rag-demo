Dot Matrix Printers. If a character on the monitor screen were to be magnified, you would see that instead of being made up of solid lines, the character is in fact composed of a series of dots created with light. Each character is typically comÂ­posed of seven or more dots. The series of dots used to build characters is called a dot matrix. The dot-matrix printer uses the same method for building characters to print letters on paper. In the printer there is a single print head with an array of small wires. When a character is sent to the printer, these print head wires punch out the shape of the character through the ink ribbon to create its impression on the paper (Fig. 6-2).
