A second prompt asks if the printer is to be tested. Again, enter Y or N. If the answer is yes, you are then prompted to enter the printer carriage length and the printer controller slot number. A third prompt asks if the disk drive(s) are to be tested. Enter either Y or N . If the answer is yes, you are then prompted to enter the number of drives to be exerÂ­cised. Using the Exerciser, all the disk drives on the Apple II can be tested sequentially. Enter the appropriate number between 1 and 6 to indicate the number of drives you wish to test. The program then prompts you for the slot number of each of the drives to be tested. Enter the appropriate number, 0 through 7, as indicated on the expansion slot itself. If running a IIe, specify slot 6 . Finally, the program prompts you to enter which drive is to be tested. Each drive board can control two disk drives, drive 1 or 2. Enter the disk address for the drive to be tested for that board (Fig. 9- 1).
