Interfacing with a Modem. The modem is a device widely used for serial communication (Fig. 8-2). It allows transmission and reception of computer data using telephone lines. The word modem is derived from the term MODulator-DEModulator. The computer produces data and control signals in the form of electrical impulses of +5 volts, or 0 volts. These impulses are either ON or OFF, respectively. When the signal is ON, it is interpreted as a 1 bit. When the signal is OFF, it is interpreted as a 0 bit. All the information existing in computer programs and data is held in a series of 1s and 0s, or digital signals. The modem is the intermediary for sending information from one computer to another. It converts the originating computer's digital signal into sound waves. These sound waves, or analog signals, allow for the transmission of information over telephone line.s. This part of the conversion is referred to as modulation. The modem at the receiving end converts the analog signal back into a digital signal. This part of the conversion is referred to as demodulation. Since the information is returned to 1s and 0s, it can be successfully interpreted by the computer connected to the receiving modem (Fig. 8-3).
