If the Serial Communication Diagnostic module checks out, reload the communication program and make sure that the parameters are set cor­rectly. Is the baud rate set correctly? Was the appropriate character or word size specified? Is the other system expecting a parity bit to be enabled? If possible, check the device with which you're trying to communicate. If it's another Apple II, run the diagnostic program on it to see whether its commu­nication interface is working properly. If it's an online service, call their help line for further technical assistance. Check the interface or system technical manual to see if the interface cable has any special requirements. RS-232 is a relatively loose standard. Some cable manufacturers use a different scheme for their RS-232 cable pins. These cables might expect data from different pins, expect different signals, or have signals tied together. If this is the case, either have the cable modified to match your required pin configuration, or purchase another one with the correct pinouts. Consult the cable manufacturer for further information. Most modems provide additional assistance with troubleshooting, through its row of red indicator lights across its front status panel (Fig. 8-7). If your modem includes such an indicator panel, check that the signals are correct. For instance, when the modem is properly cabled into the Apple II, and the communication software is being run, the lights over TR (Terminal Ready) and DSR (Data Set Ready) should be illuminated. These lights indicate that the computer and modem are ready and that the interface signals are turned on and ready to communicate with one another. If these indicator lights are not on, there may be a problem with the interface cable connection or with the modem. When data are being sent, the indicator lights over RD (Receive Data) or TD (Transmit Data) are lit. When a key is pressed, these lights illuminate to show that the data for the key code are indeed being sent.
