Description and Function of the Keyboard. The keyboard is used to type characters to enter data, form commands, make selections, and move the cursor while working within a program or application. The characters are sent to the CPU, which interprets and processes them, causing the appropriate results to be displayed on the monitor (Fig. 4-1). The Apple II uses an integral keyboard, meaning it is housed together with the system unit. The CPU, memory, interfaces, and keyboard are all contained in one housing (Fig. 4-2). The key set found on the Apple II keyboards consists of the "QWERTY" typewriter keys (named for the first six alphabetic characters found on the second row a typewriter), cursor control keys, and a numeric keypad. The IIe keyboard has additional function keys such as the CONTROL, CAPS LOCK, ESCAPE, and DELETE keys. There are also two special "Apple" keys, one open, and the other solid.
