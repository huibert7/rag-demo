Open the system unit and locate the disk drive controller board (this only applies to Apple II Plus and IIe systems). Pull the board out of the slot (see Chapter 1 for board handling and cleaning procedures) and clean oxidation from the edge connector. Carefully reseat the board in its slot. If there are only one or two drives, made sure the controller is installed in slot #6. If your drive still does not write, swap your disk drive controller on another Apple II system. If you use an Apple IIc, either swap the entire motherboard or the drive controller chip. If the other disk drive works, your system has a faulty disk drive. If the other disk drive does not work with your controller, then a certain chip on the drive controller board is faulty and should be replaced. Refer to "Working With IC Chips" in Chapter l for further instructions on handling and replacing chips. On the II Plus and IIe, use the chip extractor to carefully remove the MC3470, CA3146, 74LS125, and ULN2003 chips from the disk drive con­troller board. On the IIc, remove the IWM chip from the motherboard. Take the chip(s) to an electronics supply store and obtain a replacement(s). Care­fully install the new chips(s) in the socket(s). If the other system worked with your drive controller, then you have a faulty disk drive. Swap the drive on another system. If your drive does not work, it is defective, and should be taken to an Apple II service outlet for further troubleshooting and repair. If your drive does work on another system, and you have already checked out the drive controller, then you have a problem with the motherboard. Refer to Chapter 3 for system unit troubleshooting procedures.
