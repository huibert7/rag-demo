Problem: Data Mismatch - Read/Write Circuitry is Defective. If a large number of data mismatch errors are encountered when you run the Disk Drive Diagnostic module as indicated by the "THERE WERE X ERRORS ENCOUNTERED DURING TEST" message displayed at the end of the test, this means that the records that were written by the test do not match with the records that were read. This points to a problem with the read/write circuitry in the drive controller. Solutions: Replace one or more chips on the drive controller board. Refer to "Working With IC Chips" in Chapter 1 for further instructions on handling and replacing chips. On the II Plus and IIe, use the chip extractor to carefully remove the MC3470, CA3146, 74LS125, and ULN2003 chips from the disk drive con­ troller board. On the IIc, remove the IWM chip from the motherboard. Take the chip(s) to an electronics supply store and obtain a replacement(s). Care­fully install the new chip(s) in the socket(s). Run the Disk Drive Diagnostic again. There should be no errors returned from the Read/Write Test. If the errors persist, contact an Apple II service outlet. The drive controller or the motherboard might need more in-depth troubleshooting.
