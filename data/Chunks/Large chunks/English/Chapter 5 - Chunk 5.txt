High-Resolution Graphics Monitor. Some software programs utilize the high­ resolution graphics mode, which illuminates every speck of light, or pixel picture element, in different combinations to form pictures. These pixels allow the cre­ation and display of computer drawings and graphics on the screen. The greater the number of pixels, the better the screen resolution. The better the screen resolution, the sharper the displayed image. This is why the different types of high-resolution monitors are classified by the actual number of horizon­tal and vertical pixels that can be accommodated on the screen at one time. The Apple graphics monitors accommodate 280 x 192 monochrome pixels. The various display modes are selected through the software program currently in use, or through BASIC commands.
