### Problem: Monitor Needs to Be Serviced.

If the troubleshooting procedures described above fail to solve the monitor problem, call your Apple II service center and speak with a technician. Describe the make of your monitor, and the problem it is experiencing. Also describe what you have already tried to do to find and fix the problem, and report the results. Find out if there are any solutions they can suggest over the phone.

If the monitor cannot be repaired over the phone, ask the technician if you should bring in just the monitor, or if the system unit should be brought in as well. After supplying all available information about the monitor malfunction, find out if the technician has any ideas yet on what the problem might be, and how long and how much it might cost to fix. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before you pay for and accept your monitor, have the repair technician demonstrate that the problem has actually been fixed. When you get the monitor home again, connect everything together, and refer to Chapter 9,"The ExerÂ­ciser," for instructions on burning in the system after repair. The Exerciser includes an extensive monitor burn-in procedure that should prove very helpful.
