Determine Potential Device Problems. Once you know the functions of the device, take the inverse of these functions to consider the device's potential problems. In other words, if a device is supposed to perform a particular function, a potential problem is simply that it does not perform this function. Further research in the device's troubleshooting guide will provide you with more deÂ­ tailed information about potential problems. This will probably be your best resource.
