Read the Device Manual. Read the device documentation as soon as you obtain the new peripheral. This will familiarize you with the new device, indicate how to use it most efficiently, and show what information is available and where it can be found. Specifically, the manual provides instruction on the proper instal­lation, setup, use, operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the device. The documentation first covers unpacking and installation instructions, which should be followed carefully to minimize potential problems. Then the manual describes operation, the various functions and special features, and gives examples of applications and capabilities. Procedures for various options and settings are provided as necessary. The manual also covers the integration of the device with other system components and software. Suggestions are provided on existing hardware and software setup in order for the new device to work properly and efficiently. If applicable, the documentation describes how to install accompanying soft­ ware and how to program the device. The manual usually includes a trouble­ shooting guide which outlines problems that can occur and suggests remedial procedures to follow in response to these problems.
