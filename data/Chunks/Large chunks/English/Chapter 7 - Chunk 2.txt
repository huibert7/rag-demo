To provide an unlimited storage capacity, and to prevent the loss of valuable programs and data, the floppy diskette drive is used. The disk drive provides the additional storage necessary to supplement system memory. When you com­mand the computer to save a file, the program currently in system memory is written onto the diskette. The file is written in digital form, as a series of ON and OFF bits, or 1s and 0s. Likewise, when you command the computer to retrieve a saved file, the system recalls the information stored on the diskette. It places it into system memory just as it was when last saved. The disk drive also allows you to buy prerecorded programs and load them into your system. Saving and retrieving files points out the two storage functions the diskette drive provides: recording, or writing, information from the computer onto the diskette; and playing back, or reading, information from the diskette into com­puter memory.
