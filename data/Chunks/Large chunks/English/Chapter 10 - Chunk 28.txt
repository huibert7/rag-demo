Tracking a Graphic Object. Depending on the application software using the game paddle, a certain object on the screen is programmed to move in accordance with the movement of the game paddle control wheel. When the wheel is turned toward the right, or clockwise, the object on the screen tracks to the right. When the game paddle is turned toward the left, or counterclockwise, the object tracks to the left. The game paddle control causes the particular object on the screen to follow its movements. A potentiometer varies the signal received by the game port according to the direction, speed, and extent to which the user is turning the game paddle wheel. This operation is very similar to that of a light dimmer switch. The varying signals cause different results in the game, usually positioning an object at a certain place on the screen.
