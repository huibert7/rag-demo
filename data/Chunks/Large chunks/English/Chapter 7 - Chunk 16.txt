The Disk Drive. The floppy disk drive requires perhaps a greater degree of preventive mainteÂ­nance than the other subassemblies that make up the Apple II system. It is a very delicate mechanism, in which a single piece of dust in the wrong place can prove catastrophic to programs and data, causing the disk drive head to crash onto the surface of the floppy diskette. Make sure that the disk drive doors are closed when not in use, and cover the disk drive with its dust cover. Both of these measures prevent dirt and dust from collecting on the disk drive head mechanism. When you move your system, insert the cardboard diskette that comes with the drive, and close the door. This protects the head mechanism from being jolted, thereby preventing it from going out of alignment during transport. Purchase a disk drive head cleaning kit from a computer store, and clean the drive head at least once a month. Follow the instructions that come with the cleaning kit. Often these kits are supplied with a short program that positions the head over the cleaning diskette. The head is cleaned as the IPA impregnated cleaning diskette flashes off any material that might have accumulated on it.
