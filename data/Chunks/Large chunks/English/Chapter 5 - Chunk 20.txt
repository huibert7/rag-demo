### Problem: Static on the Television Screen.

If you are using a television monitor, and it displays static, or snow, rather than a picture, it could indicate a problem with the television set, the RF converter, or the system unit.

**Solutions**:

- First, check your television. Switch the RF converter to the TV mode, or disconnect it altogether. Set the television channel selector to a known working television station. For example, if channel 2 television broadcasts are usually received in your area, switch it to channel 2. If channel 2 does not come in, nor does any other channel, this indicates a problem with the television's tuning or receiving circuitry, and it should be taken to a televi­sion repair shop for servicing.

  If television broadcast pictures are received with no problem, then the televi­sion is working fine, and the RF converter should be tested.

  The RF converter has two switch positions: COMPUTER and TV. Make sure that the converter is switched to the COMPUTER position. Also, check that the converter is properly connected to the VHF rather than UHF antenna leads.

  Next, make certain the television channel selector is set at Channel 33 to work with your computer.
  If the screen still just shows static, replace the RF converter. You can purchase one at a stereo or electronics store.

- If you try all these tests with your television set and RF converter, and there is still static on the television screen, then the system unit is probably malfunc­tioning. Refer to Chapter 3 on how to troubleshoot system unit problems.
