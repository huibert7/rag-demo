### Etching.

Always be sure to turn the monitor off or turn the brightness down whenever you leave the computer for a while. This will easily prevent etching, which can be an expensive problem.

Etching, or ghosting, takes place on the screen when one particular format, such as a text editor menu or database screen, is left displayed on the screen for long periods of time without changing. If the computer is left running with the same image displayed for many hours a day, or many days a week, the constant bombardment of the electrons on the same area of the picture tube can permaÂ­nently burn, or etch, that image into the screen.

After etching occurs, even when something else is displayed, a ghost image of the etched display can still be seen. At the same time, the display you want to see is fainter and less defined. Once it happens, nothing can erase the image etched into the display. In other words, etching cannot be fixed, outside of buying a new monitor. The key in this case is prevention. To prevent etching, either turn off the display or turn down the brightness when the computer is not in use.
