Running the Serial Comm Interface Diagnostic Module. The Serial Communication Diagnostic module checks that the interface and the interface address are both working properly. It also tests whether the system is receiving the same data that it is sending through the communication loop. To run the Serial Communication Diagnostic module, first connect the RS-232 serial communications interface cable to the serial communications ribbon cable port coming out of the system unit. Then take the free end of the RS-232 cable, and instead of plugging it into the modem or other communication device, attach a wire between pins 2 and 3 (Fig. 8-8). Pin 2 is the receive data line, while pin 3 is the transmit data line. Placing a wire bridge or jumper across these two pins causes the data that is sent out to be looped back and received. In other words, any character entered at the Apple II keyboard is sent out to the device, immediately received in through these pins and sent back to the computer. The character will be echoed back and displayed on the screen (Fig. 8-9). There are test connectors available that already have pins 2 and 3 wired together. Called a 25-pin serial loopback connector, it can be purchased at most computer or electronic supply stores. The loopback connector fits directly onto the end of the RS-232 cable, and accomplishes the same loopback effect (Fig. 8-10).
