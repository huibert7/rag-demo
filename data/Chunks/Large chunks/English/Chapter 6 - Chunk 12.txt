Printer Preventive Maintenance. Protect the printer with a dust cover whenever it is not being used. Once a month, use a hand-held vacuum cleaner or compressed air to vacuum or blow around the printer mechanism. This removes any dust and dirt that might have accumulated. It also removes the paper and ink particles created during printing. Make sure the printer power is off before cleaning. About once a month, moisten a piece of lint-free paper with denatured isoproÂ­pyl alcohol and clean the daisy wheel character petals on a letter-quality printer, or the print head on a dot-matrix printer. This gently cleans off the dried ink and paper bits that can accumulate. Also, use lint-free paper moistened with denatured isopropyl alcohol to wipe down the printer platen, the cylinder around which the paper rolls. Rotate the platen with the platen control knob to clean all sides. Wipe down the printer case with lint-free paper and denatured isopropyl alcohol to complete your printer preventive maintenance.
