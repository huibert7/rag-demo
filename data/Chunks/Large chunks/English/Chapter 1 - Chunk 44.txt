Remember, clockwise is on, counterclockwise is off. Turn the screw to the left to disassemble the unit. Turn the screw to the right to reassemble the unit. When screwing a unit back together again, always place the screws into their holes with just a couple turns. This lets you situate and align the unit properly before tightening down. If a unit is being reassembled with more than three screws, tighten the screws down in a criss-cross fashion (Fig. 1-6). Start at one corner, then screw the opposite corner. Continue in this star manner until all the screws are tightened down. This allows for a properly aligned and tightened unit, and also prevents the screws from being stripped.
