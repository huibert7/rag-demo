Problem: A Peripheral Does Not Work Properly. If one of the peripherals does not work properly, or does not work at all, try the following solutions. Solutions: Refer to the chapter in this book covering that particular peripheral, and follow the suggested troubleshooting and repair procedures. Refer to the above solutions, under "System Unit Does Not Have Power," "Oxidation Needs to be Removed," and "Boards and Cables Need to be Reseated," and follow those suggestions. If the peripheral still does not work, refer to the peripheral documentation. There might be a DIP-switch on the controller board that needs to be set, particularly on the serial communication interface board. The printer itself might have DIP-switches. A DIP-switch is a dual inline plastic switch containing a number of micro switches mounted on a board (Fig. 3-7), each of which can be set to ON or OFF. The different microswitches can each control a different setting, mode, or configuration; can work in various combinations; or the entire switch can have a specified ON/OFF sequence of the microswitches which indicate a particular setting. Switch settings are read by the system unit when it is powered on, and determine whether or not a certain configuration or setting is enabled. An incorrect switch setting for your particular Apple II configuration can cause a malfunction in the peripheral or even in the entire system. Information about switch settings is found in your peripheral documentation.
