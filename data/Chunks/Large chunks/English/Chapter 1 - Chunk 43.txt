When disassembling a unit by removing the screws, keep all the screws in one place where they won't roll away and get lost. Putting them in a shallow bowl or ashtray is a good practice. If there are different types of screws coming out at different places, it's a good idea to keep these separate from each other. This will prevent you from inadvertently replacing the wrong screws in the wrong holes when reassembling.
