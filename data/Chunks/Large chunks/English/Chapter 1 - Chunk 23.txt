Setup. When you set up your system for the first time, be sure to follow the installation instructions provided in the Apple II user guide. Situate the computer in a clean, cool, relatively dust-free environment. Place the computer in as permanent a location as possible. The less the computer is moved, the fewer problems it will have. Set all parts of your system on a flat, secure surface. For example, don't teeter any part of the system on the edge of a table. Don't have loose cords hanging where someone could trip and hurt themselves as well as the computer. Do not place your computer near any power supplies, appliances, or any other items that contain some type of motor. A motor creates a magnetic field, which can interfere with the data written magnetically on your diskettes. This magnetic interference could easily erase or garble your programs and data.
