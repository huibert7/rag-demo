### How the Monitor Functions.

The monitor consists of a cathode ray tube, power supply, and the contrast, brightness, and vertical/horizontal hold adjustments. The CRT is a large vacuum tube with a display area similar to a television screen. An electron gun inside the vacuum tube collects, focuses, and emits an electron beam for controlled contact on the back of the picture tube, which is coated with phosphors. As the electrons strike the phosphor atoms, the atoms begin to glow. This reaction forms a small, clearly defined light spot (Fig. 5-3).

A special matrix of these light spots are the dots that form each of the characÂ­ters. On a monochrome monitor, about seven of these light spots positioned in a certain manner make up one character. On a high-resolution monitor, these light spots are the pixels which can densely form the characters, graphic elements, and drawings. The series of dots used to build characters is called the dot matrix.
