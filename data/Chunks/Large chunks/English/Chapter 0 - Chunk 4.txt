Introduction. You will find that your Apple II computer is quite a marvel. You might use the Apple II+, IIe, or IIc computer to help manage a small business, do schoolwork, budget home finances, keep records, write, or play games. The Apple can help you to become more efficient and organized. It can provide you with information, resources, and capabilities formerly unavailable. But just when you're really rolling, you get your first silicon slap-in-the-face: your computer breaks down! Only at that moment do you realize that your computer is not a magical wonder - it's an electromechanical applicance, simiÂ­lar to your television, stereo, or automobile. It has moving mechanical parts that wear out. It has integrated circuit chips and other electronic components that short out and fail. And there are a number ofother little problems that can cause big worries.
