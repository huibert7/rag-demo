Function of the Exerciser Module. The System Exerciser module calls on diagnostic tests that are already a part of individual component diagnostic modules elsewhere in the System Diagnostic Program. Specifically, it branches to routines in the Monitor Diagnostic module, Printer Diagnostic module, and Disk Drive Diagnostic module. When the System Exerciser module is accessed, a menu will be displayed. This menu prompts you to specify the devices to be tested, the monitor, printer, and/or disk drives. Any combination of devices can be specified for inclusion in or exclusion from the Exerciser. These component parameters may be set up in whatever combination is convenient and appropriate for the system. Once the parameters are set up, the System Exerciser immediately begins to perform the continuous test on the specified devices. This means the Exerciser could be run for hours, even overnight if desired. The Exerciser runs nonstop until it encounters an error, or until it is stopped with CTRL RESET.
