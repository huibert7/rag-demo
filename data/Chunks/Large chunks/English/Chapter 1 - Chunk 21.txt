Safety. Certain safety precautions must be followed whenever working with any kind of electrical device. Before disconnecting cables or opening any part of the system, unplug the ac connector from its source, usually the electrical outlet or ac strip. Never work with an open system if it is "live," or electrically powered. Even when the electricity is disconnected from an open system, ground yourÂ­ self by touching metal before touching the system. When you are grounded, electrical charges are not attracted through your body, and you are prevented from electrical shock.
