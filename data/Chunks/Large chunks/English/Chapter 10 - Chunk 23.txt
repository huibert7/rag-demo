When you feel that the program is thoroughly tested and edited, and that it can withstand any condition without a bug cropping up, hand the program over to someone else for testing. It is a general rule that the programmer cannot thor­oughly test his own program. In fact, professional software development compa­nies often have a separate testing or quality assurance group, whose sole function is to test software after coding is complete. This is because as the programmer, you are too familiar with your own work, and as a result, you can become blind to certain aspects of the program. An outside, impartial user is the truest test of the new program. Have the tester follow the same general testing techniques described above. They will invariably try different functions, different values, different limits, and different combinations than you might have ever considered. As a result, the tester might find additional bugs to be fixed. This is the best way to create a good program as close to perfection as possible. After all testing cycles are completed, you can finally feel confident about integrating the diagnostic program as a new module in the System Diagnostic Program.
