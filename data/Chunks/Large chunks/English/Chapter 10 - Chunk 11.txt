Program Analysis (Flowcharting). The program analysis phase lets you design the actual program, taking into consideration the overall logic and flow of the program. Program analysis is done with a graphic aid called a flowchart. The program flowchart is a detailed picture that represents the process, or flow, of steps to be performed within the computer to produce the desired results. The flowchart provides the road map that will be a guide when writing the program code. Write a separate flowchart for each test identified in the system design table. Each test is considered a sub-module of the device diagnostic program, which in turn will eventually become a module of the entire Apple II System Diagnostic Program. Program analysis actually consists of creating two different flowcharts: the system flowchart in a plain English organizational overview, and the program flowchart being the bridge between plain English and BASIC, indicating the specific program flow and structure.
