Key Location. Pressing a key on the keyboard causes an electromechanical process to take place, similar to toggling a light switch or pressing a button on a television to change channels. Each key post is positioned over a wire matrix, with each post being directly over the crossover of an X (horizontal) wire, and a Y (vertical) wire. The contact with this crossover point generates a column/row value indicating the originating keyboard location. The keyboard location information, which is calculated by the keyboard colÂ­umn/row matrix, is sent to an encoder on the keyboard controller. This encoder is a counter circuit with a built-in ROM containing the ASCII character set. Based on the matrix value of the pressed key, and based on whether or not the SHIFT or CTRL key was pressed in conjunction with the key, an ASCII value representing the pressed key is generated. ASCII Value. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) values are used to represent the standard display characters, such as A through Z, as an eight-bit binary ( 1 s and Os) code which can be interpreted and processed by the computer. For example, the letter "A" translates into the ASCII value of 1000001, with a decimal equivalent of 65.
