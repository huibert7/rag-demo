If a greater number of mismatch errors are found by the diagnostic, then you have a problem in the read/write circuitry in the drive controller. Refer to "Prob­lem: Data Mismatch - Read/Write Circuitry is Defective" above for suggestions on correcting this problem. If any fatal errors are found during the test, the error message will be displayed and the test will halt.
