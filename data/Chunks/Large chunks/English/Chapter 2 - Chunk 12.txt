The System Exerciser module resides at lines 4000 through 4320. If you have just purchased a new Apple II system, or if you've just brought the computer back from servicing, it's a good idea to "burn in" the system. Burn-in is a continuous testing mode that exercises all system functions. This is particularly useful beÂ­ cause most computer problems take place when the system is first set up, or when the computer is moved. The Exerciser module allows you to burn in and check system functions automatically and unattended. Further information about the System Exerciser can be found in Chapter 9.
