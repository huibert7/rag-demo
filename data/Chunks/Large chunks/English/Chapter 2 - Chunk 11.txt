Lines 3500 through 3600 contain the Serial Communication Diagnostic modÂ­ule, which tests the serial communication interface. For this test, the user presses a key on the keyboard, and the character and its ASCII value is displayed on the screen. This "loopback" test determines whether or not the modem interface is functioning accurately.
