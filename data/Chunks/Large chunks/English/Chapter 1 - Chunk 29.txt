Power Surge Protection. The electricity supplied at the electrical wall outlet is rated at 110/120 volts at 60 Hertz (cycles per second). There are moments when surges of electricity exceed 110/ 120 volts, and other moments when sags in voltage are lower than nominal. You've probably experienced drops in electricity when the lights flicker or dim in intensity. This brown-out effect might cause the keyboard to temporarily lock up, and you might lose some data due to logic-re­lated problems within the computer. The most damaging problem is the voltage surge. A power surge can pass through the power supply's filter circuits by giving it more peak voltage than it can effectively suppress. The Apple II power supply takes the 110 / 120 volts AC and rectifies it to 5, 12, or 15 volts DC. These are the voltages with which the inte­grated circuits in the computer are designed to operate. When the computer's power supply receives a large power surge or spike, it is not capable of suppressing it. This instantaneous spike is sent through to the chips, damaging or even destroying them. The spike not only damages circuits but also causes the system to fail, wiping out everything you're working on currently stored in system memory.
