### Problem: Missing Text Mode Character Location.

If  you're entering characters in the text mode, and you notice that there is a location on the screen into which you are not able to display any character, then there is a problem with the text mode character location. Try the following solutions.

**Solutions**:

- Run the Display Test of the Monitor Diagnostic module. This test fills the entire screen with an entered character. Any blank locations indicate a problem with those text character locations.

  If the Display Test reveals no blank locations, then the problem is not with the monitor, but with the software you were using when the blanks occurred. Also check to see if there's a problem with a specific character, rather than a character screen location.

  If the test reveals blank locations, then there is a problem with the video memory circuitry for that text character location. Each character represents a video memory location. If the character does not display at a certain location, but it does display at other locations, it means the memory locaÂ­tion, controlled by one of the RAM chips, is defective.

  Each RAM chip is labeled RAM beside its socket on the floor of the motherboard. Unplug your system, open it up, and carefully remove one of the RAMs using a chip extractor (refer to "Working with IC Chips" in Chapter 1). Take the chip to an electronics supply store and buy one or two exact replacements. Replace the new RAM in the original socket, and check if the problem is still present.

- If the location is still blank, unplug your system again, open it up, and replace the old RAM in its original socket. Remove a different RAM and replace it will the new one. Tum the system on again and check for the problem. Continue in this manner, shotgunning the bank of RAM chips until the malfunctioning location is present once again.

- If the character location remains blank after replacing all the RAMS, take the motherboard in for servicing.
