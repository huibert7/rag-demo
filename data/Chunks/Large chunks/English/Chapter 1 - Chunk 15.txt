User Resources. As you become more and more involved with your computer, resources be­come more and more important. It becomes less critical to know everything if you have good resources that provide accurate information. If you still cannot find the source of a problem after trying all the troubleshoot­ing steps, call your local Apple II dealer. Many stores and service outlets will assist with valuable information if you can ask specific questions. That friend of yours with an Apple II system might have knowledge you do not. Exchange information with any other Apple II users of your acquaintance. Every­ one has a different baseline of computer experience and knowledge.
