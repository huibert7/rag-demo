If the system flowchart includes a step which you do not know how to translate into the program flowchart, some additional research will be needed. Refer to a BASIC manual, the Applesoft BASIC reference guide, and the device manual for further information on how to program for a particular task. Include details of your research results in the flowchart, so it will not be necessary to look it up again when it is time for the coding stage. Although the program flowchart does not generally use the BASIC commands, the name of the BASIC command might incidentally be included in a given flowchart box. If desired, include the pertinent BASIC command in the flowchart box to which it applies. This additional level of detail can help later when coding. Make the program flowchart as detailed as possible. The more detailed the flowchart is, the easier and more trouble-free the coding will tend to be. The objective is to establish the program's flow and logic to the point where the program can easily be written.
