When you run the test, use a recently formatted, blank diskette. Do not use a diskette that contains data on it, because the test will run out of room on the diskette, and an error message will be returned. The Disk Drive Diagnostic begins with two prompts. The first prompt asks for the slot number in which the disk drive controller resides, 0 through 7. A second prompt asks for the specific drive on that controller to be tested, 1 or 2 (Fig. 7- 14). The diagnostic creates a file called "TEST," and makes four distinct passes through the specified disk. Running the Disk Drive Diagnostic takes approximately 20 minutes, with five minutes per pass through the disk. If you wish to halt the program during this test, press CTRL C. The System Diagnostic Program will be halted, and the Applesoft BASIC environment will be displayed. Depending on when the program was halted, the "TEST" file might still be on the test diskette, and you might wish to delete it.
