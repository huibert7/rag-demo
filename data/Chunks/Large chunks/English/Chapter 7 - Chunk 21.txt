Problem: The Disk Drive Does Not Work. If your disk drive cannot read from or write to a diskette, try the following solutions. Solutions: Check how the diskette was inserted. If it's inserted upside-down, the drive cannot read from or write to it. The Apple II systems use horizontal disk drives, in which the diskette should be inserted face up, or diskette label up. The disk drive has an in-use indicator light next to the drive door. This light indicates that the drive is currently executing a read or write operation. If your system boots up displaying the cursor on the screen, and the fan is running but the disk drive in-use indicator light is not illuminated, then there's a good chance that no power is being supplied to the disk drive. Another indicator is if no program loads from the diskette, and only the Applesoft BASIC prompt is displayed, this indicates that the drive has no power. Check that power is being supplied to the drive. Its power comes from the system unit power supply. Check that the drive is properly connected to the system unit. If the power checks out, but the drive indicator is not on, and the drive still cannot be accessed, there is a problem with the cable or controller. Take the drive in for servicing. If the operating system does not load, and you do not even see the Applesoft BASIC right bracket prompt, check that the disk drive interface cable is properly connected between the drive and the motherboard. If your Apple II configuration includes more than one disk drive, there might be an addressing problem from the software. Make sure that the disk is being properly addressed by the program in use. The disk address is based on the expansion slot in which the disk drive controller resides, such as slot #4. Because two disk drives can be connected to each controller, the address also must include the drive connector numÂ­ber :D1 or D2. An example of a disk drive address would be "Slot4D1,"or "Slot 6 D2," and so forth.
