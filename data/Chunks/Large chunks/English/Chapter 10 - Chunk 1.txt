Chapter 10 - Writing Diagnostics for Other Peripherals. It is important to be able to isolate and identify the source of any problem in your Apple II system. The Apple II System Diagnostic Program provides the means for locating problems in your system unit, keyboard, monitor, printer, disk drives, or serial communication interface. Based on the results, you can then make repairs on the indicated subsystem. However, if your system uses peripherals not covered by this program, it might be advantageous to write new diagnostic modules for them. In this way, the System Diagnostic Program can grow with your computer system, and new or different components will not be excluded from the diagnostic loop that tests the rest of the system. Using the game paddle as an example, this chapter will demonstrate and explain how to research and identify the basic functions of a new device, as well as the types of problems you might experience using it. This information will then lead you to determine the kinds of tests necessary for an effective diagnostic module. Flowcharting and coding advice will be provided, along with integration and testing procedures. If you are not familiar with BASIC, refer to Chapter2, "The System Diagnostic Program." That chapter briefly describes the Applesoft BASIC commands used throughout the System Diagnostic Program. It also points out other resources for learning and using BASIC in more depth.
