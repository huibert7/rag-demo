When the personal computer was invented in the '70s, a new kind of storage disk was introduced: the eight-inch floppy diskette. They were called floppy, because unlike their metal predecessors, the recording media consisted of a smaller platter made of thin, flexible plastic, which was encased in a protective plastic covering. The technology brought about by the microcomputer revoluÂ­tion had miniaturized everything about the computer, including the disk drive. The microcomputer's components continued to shrink in various ways. Among these components were the disk drive and diskette. Soon the 5 1/4-inch mini-floppy diskette with its 5 1/4-inch disk drive became the standard. There are even micro-floppies, at 3 1/2 inches (Fig. 7-3). These diskettes are smaller and easier to use than the 8-inch versions. The Apple II systems use 5 1/4-inch floppy diskettes.
