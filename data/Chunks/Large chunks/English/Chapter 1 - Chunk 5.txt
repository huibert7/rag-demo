Monitor. The monitor, also known as a "cathode ray tube" (CRT) or "video display," is the visual output for work input on the Apple. It shows the input data from the keyboard, modem, mouse, game paddle, or other input device; it also displays the results of system processing performed within the system unit. The Apple II usually uses a color monitor, which can be either a standard television set or a computer monitor. The IIe also supports both 40-column or 80-column displays.
