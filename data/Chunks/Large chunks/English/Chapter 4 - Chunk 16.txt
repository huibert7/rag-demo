Running the Keyboard Diagnostic Module. The Keyboard Diagnostic module consists of the Echo Key Test. This test displays, or echos, any key pressed on the keyboard along with its ASCII value. If you press a special character or key combination, the name of the character or combination is displayed, along with its ASCII value. Run the Keyboard Diagnostic module, and then press a key. This test will read and displays the key, and let you check whether or not it, or even the entire keyboard, is working. The Keyboard Diagnostic module also displays the key's ASCII value, letting you check whether the keys are sending the proper code to the computer to display the proper text character, graphic symbol, special characÂ­ter, or function. The Apple II Reference Manual, provided with your Apple II system, includes a table that shows which key and/or function each ASCII value is supposed to provide.
