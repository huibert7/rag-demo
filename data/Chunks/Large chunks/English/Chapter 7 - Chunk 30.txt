Try reading from and writing to another diskette that you know is formatted. If you are successful with this diskette, and the error message is not returned, then the original diskette probably was not formatted. If the error message is returned when requesting access to a certain file, give the `CATALOG` command to see if the file is present on the diskette. If the file is present, then there is a problem with the diskette itself. Try the diskette's backup. Run the Disk Drive Diagnostic module on a blank, formatted diskette. If the diagnostic does not display any error messages with this diskette, then the original diskette was defective, and its backup should be used. If further error messages are displayed with the new diskette, the disk drive controller or the drive itself might be defective. Swap the disk drive controller on another system. If it does not work, then a certain chip on the drive controller board is faulty and should be taken in for servicing, or replaced. Refer to "Working with IC Chips" in Chapter 1 for further instructions on replacing chips.
