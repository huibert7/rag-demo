Problem: Fire Button Does Not Work. The switch that controls the fire button can also get stuck. This would be indicated if the fire button is pressed, and either nothing happens or it keeps on firing, even after the button is released. Solutions: Check the c.able connection and make sure the game paddle connection is properly plugged into the port. Following instructions found in the game paddle user guide, carefully disas­semble the game paddle. Spray contact cleaner onto the fire button switch. This should unstick the switch. Swap another game paddle onto the system, if available. If the other game paddle works on the system, then your game paddle is defective, and should be replaced. If the other game paddle does not work on the system, then you have a problem with your system unit. Refer to Chapter 3 for further solu­tions.
