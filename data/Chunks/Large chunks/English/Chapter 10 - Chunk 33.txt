Problem: Game Paddle Does Not Work at All. If the game paddle does not work at all, it could be a problem with the interface connection, the game paddle, or the system unit. To isolate the problem, try the following solutions in the order given. Solutions: Make sure the game paddle is firmly seated in its game paddle port. Unplug the game paddle from its socket port on the motherboard, and carefully plug it back in. If the game paddle still does not work, unplug the game paddle cable from its game paddle socket port, and plug it into the second port. If the game paddle works in the other port, then there is a problem in the original port in the system unit. Refer to Chapter 3 for further instructions on troubleshooting the system unit. If the game paddle does not work in any of the four game paddle ports, try operating the game paddle on another system. Also run the Game Paddle Diagnostic on the other system. If the game paddle works on the other system, then there is a problem with the system unit. Refer to Chapter 3 for system unit troubleshooting procedures. If the game paddle does not work on the other system, then you have a faulty game paddle. Spray the potentiometer wheel with contact cleaner (Fig. 10-7). If necessary, follow the instructions in the game paddle user guide to open it up, and then spray the underside of the potentiometer wheel and the fire button switch with contact cleaner. If the game paddle still does not work, refer to the game paddle documenÂ­tation for further troubleshooting and repair instructions.
