System Unit Preventive Maintenance. Place a dust cover on the system unit/keyboard whenever it isn't being used. Dust and dirt can work their way down inside the system unit and corrode the ICs, rendering them defective. Food particles can interfere with circuits, and if a liquid is ever spilled onto the system unit/keyboard, the whole unit will need to be replaced. About once a month, use a hand-held vacuum cleaner or compressed air to vacuum or blow around the keyboard keys. This clears out any dust and dirt that has gotten onto the keyboard in spite of the dust cover, and prevents it from going any further down into the system unit.
