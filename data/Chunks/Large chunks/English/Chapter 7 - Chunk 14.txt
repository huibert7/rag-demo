Reading Data. When the operating system, application program, or user gives a recall or read command for a specific record or file, the CPU sends these instructions to the disk drive controller. The controller locates the requested data and sends its instructions to the disk drive head-arm assembly. The head is positioned over the proper track and sector as directed by the drive controller. The tiny magnetic fields stored in the diskette emulsion at that locaÂ­tion induce electrical impulses into the drive head, allowing the head to copy the data from the sector and transfer it to a disk buffer in system memory. At that point, the data can be used as directed by the program and the user.
