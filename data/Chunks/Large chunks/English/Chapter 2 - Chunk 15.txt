Keying in the Program. If you have not purchased the diskette, enter the program code as listed in the Appendices. To do this: Turn on the Apple system. Applesoft BASIC is automatically invoked. Enter NEW to indicate to BASIC that this is a new program. Enter the System Diagnostic Program code exactly as listed in Appendix A. Save the program after each hundred lines to protect from data loss in the event of a power or system failure. Use the command SAVE DIAG. That portion of the program is saved to the diskette. **Note**: There is nothing special about the program name of "DIAG". Name it anything you like. Just made sure it is a descriptive name, and that there is no other program by that name on that diskette. When the entire System Diagnostic Program is entered and saved to the diskette, enter RUN DIAG and test each program function to make sure there are no syntax errors. Such errors indicate typographical errors made while entering the program.
