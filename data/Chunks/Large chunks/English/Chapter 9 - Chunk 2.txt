Have the service technician describe what was done, explain why it was done, and demonstrate that the problem is now fixed as a result. However, keep in mind that even while checking the components at the repair shop, not all system functions can be checked. The technician will probably run through just a few tests for the specific problem, demonstrating that the particular component is working correctly For example, if the system unit had a problem, you probably would have taken only the system unit in for servicing, leaving the monitor, printer, disk drive, and modem behind. But the computer is a system, consisting of a number of devices and peripherals interacting to run applications. Because of this, when there is a problem in one device, it can actually manifest itself in another device.
