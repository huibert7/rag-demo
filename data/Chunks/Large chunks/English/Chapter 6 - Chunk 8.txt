Letter-Quality Printers. Another very popular printer is the letter-quality printer, sometimes referred to as a daisy-wheel printer. The output looks as though it were typed on a traditional typewriter. The letter-quality printer is often preferred by individuals who use their com­puters to do mass mailings as part of their business. Letters printed on a letter­ quality printer appear as though they were individually typed on a typewriter, rather than mass-produced with a computer. In fact, any document that a com­pany or individual wants to look particularly handsome is best done with a letter-quality printer. Letter-quality output simply looks cleaner, with sharper characters than dot-matrix output. The letter-quality printer uses a daisy wheel to create the characters. On the end of each petal of the daisy wheel is a character (Fig. 6-3).
