If the Exerciser is interrupted while running the disk drive test, there could be a file called "TEST" in the diskette's catalog listing. Delete this file from the diskette. Normally the diagnostic removes this file after its run is completed. If one of the tests fail, the Exerciser halts. So if the printer runs out of paper, or if something happens to the disk drive, the program will stop at the point at which the problem took place. An error message generated by the Apple operating system or by the disk drive diagnostic error handling routine might be displayed, indicating the problem and the appropriate action to be taken. If it is a problem for which there is no error message, the program simply halts at the point where the error occurred, and you can probably see for yourself what the problem is.
