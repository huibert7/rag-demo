If the system is able to read from a diskette, but cannot write to it, examine the diskette to see whether it is write-protected. If you've been using a particular diskette, and now find that the computer can no longer write to it, it may have worn out. Diskettes are fragile, and after a great deal of use they can actually wear out, much the same way that a phonograph record or cassette tape can wear out after long-term use. This is another reason why keeping a current backup copy of each diskette is so important. If a diskette wears out, you can simply use its backup. You can also try re-initializing the diskette. When a diskette is first initial­ized, any bad sectors are blocked out. Sometimes a bad sector can develop after initialization. In this case, the diskette can be salvaged with re-initiali­zation. Again, all bad sectors are blocked out, including the new ones, so the diskette is like new again. Remember, however, that when a diskette is reformatted, all data on it is erased. If you still cannot write to the diskette, try a different diskette, one that you have recently used and know is not defective. If the system has no problem with this diskette, the original diskette was defective. Use its backup. If you cannot write to the second diskette, then you probably have a problem with your drive. To check this, try the diskette on another system. If it does not write on the system, then you have a bad diskette. However, if it does write on the other system, then you have a problem with either your disk drive controller or the drive itself.
