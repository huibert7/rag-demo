Types of Disk Drives. The Apple II disk drive can store 143 kilobytes of data on a diskette. It is an external disk drive, meaning it resides in its own housing external to the system unit, and has its own power supply. In addition to the external drive, the Apple IIc also provides an internal disk drive, with the diskette door on the right side of the system unit. The first computers with disk drives were the mainframe computers used in large corporations. The storage media used were 14-inch metal platters (Fig. 7-2). These rigid platters, or disks, were stacked like phonograph records in the mainÂ­ frame's disk drive.
