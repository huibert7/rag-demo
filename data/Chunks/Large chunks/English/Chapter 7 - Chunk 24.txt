Problem: Cannot Write to the Diskette. A common disk drive problem is that the system cannot write data to the diskette. The first thing you should check is the diskette itself. Solutions: If your system is not writing to a brand new diskette, first make sure that it is the correct type of diskette for the drive. Make sure you are using a single足 sided, soft-sectored diskette in your drive. Check the disk drive documenta足tion for any additional diskette requirements. If the diskette is the correct type for the drive, the problem might be that the diskette is not initialized, or formatted. There are many diskette manufacturers, and the same type of diskettes can be used with a variety of com足puters. A diskette is made to work on your particular computer by inserting the diskette into the disk drive and running the operating system's initializa足tion program, which for the Apple II is the INIT command. This must be done to all new diskettes in order for them to work with your computer. The initialization format program places operating system information and a disk directory program onto the new diskette. Initializing also tests the diskette for bad sectors. If any bad sectors are found, the INIT program blocks them out. The diskette can still be used, and valuable data is prevented from being written onto bad areas.
