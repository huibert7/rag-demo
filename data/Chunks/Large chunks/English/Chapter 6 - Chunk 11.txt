Printer Interfaces. The printer is physically connected, or interfaced, to the Apple II system through an optional serial interface board. A parallel interface board is also available. The interface board is plugged into one of the expansion slots on the motherboard, and includes a receptacle that is exposed at the rear of the system unit to accept the printer cable (Fig. 6-4). A serial interface sends data one bit at a time, in a series (Fig. 6-5). This is contrasted with a parallel interface, which accepts 7 or 8 bits of data sent simultaÂ­neously by a parallel printer.
