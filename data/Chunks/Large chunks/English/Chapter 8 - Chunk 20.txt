Emulation. Different types of computers have different keyboard control se­quences, keyboard mapping, screen format display, text handling, and special functions. These aspects of unique computer design can hinder effective commu­nication between two different computers. To solve this problem, an emulation program in the communication software can disguise the Apple II and make it simulate another computer of a different design. The DEC VT100 is a common emulation mode, available with communication software, in which the Apple II can emulate the VT100 terminal. When both types of computers are set up in the same emulation mode, all code sequences for the keyboard and monitor function as expected.
