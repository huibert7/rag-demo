Working with PC Boards. When disconnecting cables in order to get to a PC board, note how the connector fits onto the receptacle. Most connectors are keyed so that they can go onto the receptacle only in one direction. Check each cable for orientation and keying before setting it aside. If it is not keyed, mark or tag it in some way so that you'll know how to plug it back in when reassembling the unit. When disconnecting several cables at the same time, make sure you know where they are connected . If they each have different types of connectors, the job is easy. However, if they are all similar to one another, mark or tag the connectors in some way so that you'll know where to connect which cables.
