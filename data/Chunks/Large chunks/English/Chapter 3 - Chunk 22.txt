Problem: System Unit Needs to Be Serviced. If the solutions described above fail to solve the system unit problem, it is time to take the unit in for servicing. First call the service center and talk to the technician. Describe the computer and its configuration, and explain the problem it's experiencing. Also describe what you have already tried to do to find and fix the problem, and indicate your results. Find out if there are any solutions they can suggest over the phone. Try all their phone solutions. One of them might fix the problem. If the problem cannot be repaired over the phone, ask the technician how much of the system you should bring to the shop. In the case of the system unit, you will probably have to take the entire system in, including monitor, interfaces, printer, game paddle, and everything else that is hooked up to the computer while it is experiencing the problem. The technician will need to look at the system as a whole. Pack everything carefully in the original cartons and packing material. Load the boxes securely in your car so that they won't fall or be jarred during a hard turn or fast stop. Provide the technician with all the information you have. Find out if the technician has any ideas on what the problem might be, and how long and how much it might cost to fix. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before you pay for and accept your computer, have the repair technician hook everything up and demonstrate that the problem has actually been fixed and your computer is working properly. If you're satisfied, then pack the system up and take it home. Set your system up again and refer to Chapter 9, "The Exerciser," for instructions on burning in the system after repair.
