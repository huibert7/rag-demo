Communication Parameters. Since data is sent one bit at a time in serial communication, certain parameters must be specified when first configuring the communication software. These parameters pertain to data transmission speed, the size of the data characters being sent, whether start bits and stop bits are employed, and whether parity error checking is to take place. The communication configuration serves to coordinate the communication and ensure that the data transfer is successful and accurate. The particular values specified in these parameters depend on the device with which the computer is communicating. The modem documentation describes how to set up the para­ meters. Online service user documentation details the specific parameters needed to communicate with their computers. The printer, modem, or other device with which the Apple II is going to communicate must have the communication interface variables set identically on their end in order that this communication link can be established and main­tained. These parameters are set either through the software or with switches on the communication interface board. Check the device documentation for spe­cific details. When running communication software for the first time, access the setup mode for these communication parameters. Once they are set, these options are usually stored on the program disk so that they are automatically implemented each time the program is used.
