How the Keyboard Functions. Three actions take place when a keyboard key is pressed. A column/row value indicating the key's location in the keyboard matrix is generated in the keyboard controller. A unique ASCII value, based on the column/row value, is generated to represent the value of the pressed key. The ASCII value is sent from the keyboard controller to the CPU, which processes the value and determines what it is supposed to do. The results are then sent to the screen, if applicable, for the appropriate display or funcÂ­tional action.
