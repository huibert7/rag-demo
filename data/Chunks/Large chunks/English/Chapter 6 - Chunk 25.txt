Printer Setup. There are two basic types of printers between which the Printer Diagnostic module must distinguish. Because of this, the Printer Setup routine is run before the Printer Diagnostic menu is even displayed. Two prompts are given (Fig. 6-6). The first prompt asks whether the printer can print up to 80 or 132 characters in one line. The default value is 80 characters. The second prompt asks for the slot number in which the printer controller board resides. This information allows the program to properly address the board while running the printer tests. Enter the slot number at the prompt, and press RETURN . If you don't know the slot number, open the system unit, and locate the printer controller board. The slot number is labeled on the motherboard in front of the slot itself. After answering these prompts and pressing RETURN , the module is set up for your printer, and the Printer Diagnostic Menu is displayed as shown in Fig. 6-7. To activate one of the printer tests, press the corresponding number, 1 through 5.
