On the II Plus and IIe, if it's a read problem, use the chip extractor to carefully remove the MC3470 and CA3146 chips. If it's a write problem, remove those two chips in addition to 74LS125 and ULN2003. On the IIc, remove the IWM chip from the motherboard. Take the chip(s) to an elecÂ­tronics supply store and obtain a replacement(s). Carefully install the new chip(s) in the socket(s).  If the disk drive controller works on the other system, troubleshoot the disk drive. Swap your disk drive on another system. If the I/O Error Message is still returned, then the drive is faulty and should be taken in for servicing. If the disk drive and controller work on the other system, but they do not work on yours, then you have a faulty motherboard. Refer to Chapter 3 for system unit troubleshooting procedures.
