Disk Drive Mechanism. The disk drive itself consists of a motor, drive head, and access arm (Fig. 7-7). When you insert a diskette into the disk drive and close the drive latch, a switch inside the drive tells the system that a diskette has been inserted. The drive motor then spins the diskette at a constant speed of 300 - 400 revolutions per minute (rpm). The small hole located near the center of the diskette is used by the disk drive circuitry for timing and synchronization. This hole senses when the diskette is spinning at the correct rpm necessary for reading or writing data. As long as the disk drive motor is rotating the diskette at the correct speed, data can be written to and read from the surface of the diskette. The head-arm assembly locates, reads, and writes data to and from the disk according to the instructions coming from the disk drive controller. The head is a magnetic device on the end of a mechanical access arm (Fig. 7-8).
