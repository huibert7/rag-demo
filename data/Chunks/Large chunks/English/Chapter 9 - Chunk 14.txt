Any combination of Exerciser parameters can be selected. Once these parame­ters are all entered, the program begins exercising the system. If the monitor is included in the Exerciser, the screen is filled with Xs for the Display Test. The screen then clears and runs through the Character Set Test. Finally, the Scroll Test is run for 50 repetitions. If the printer is included in the Exerciser, the printer tests begin upon comple­tion of the monitor testing. In total, 35 repetitions of the Sliding Alpha Test are printed. It runs through the Character Set Print Test, and then prints a line of Es for the Echo Character Print Test. The Horizontal Tab Test, and finally the Line Space Test are run, providing you with a thorough printer test. If the disk drive(s) are included in the Exerciser, the disk drive test begins upon completion of the printer testing. The write/read test is run on each disk drive specified for testing.
