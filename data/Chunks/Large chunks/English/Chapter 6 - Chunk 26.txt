Sliding Alpha Test. The Sliding Alpha Test is very similar to the sliding alpha routine used in the Scroll Test of the Monitor Diagnostic module. It serves two functions: to fully exercise the printer, and to get a sample of the full alphanumeric display character set available on the printer. When you press 1, you are prompted to enter the number of lines you wish to run. If you enter a number less than 35, the program defaults to running 35 scrolling lines. The printer begins printing a sliding alpha pattern. It types a line full of as many different characters of the character set as will fit on a line. It then feeds up another line, slides one character to the left, and prints the line of characters. The program continues to do this for the specified number of lines (Fig. 6-8).
