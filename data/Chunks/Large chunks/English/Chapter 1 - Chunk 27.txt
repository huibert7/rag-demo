Preventing Static Electricity. Static electricity is another computer foe. Static electricity, also known as electrostatic discharge, refers to the giving off of electri­cal charges that are contained in a particular object, or produced by friction, for example. Static electricity can present a serious problem to your computer. This is because the IC chips throughout the system contain minute electronic circuits that are particularly vulnerable to damage by large voltages inherent in static electricity. If you live in a dry, cool climate, the potential for static electricity is greater, so your computer stands an even greater risk of getting "zapped." Most devices within the computer run on power of up to about 15 volts, and are protected from electrical damage up to 2-5 kilovolts. However, the electro­ static discharge from a human can be more than 20 kilovolts. This means that you could easily be the source of static electricity that can damage your system's components.
