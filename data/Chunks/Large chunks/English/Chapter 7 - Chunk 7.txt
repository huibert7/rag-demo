Floppy Diskette. The floppy diskette is a magnetic recording medium coated with iron oxide, similar to the material used on cassette tapes. The iron oxide covers the surface of the diskette like a film, or emulsion, and is used because it holds a magnetic charge. The magnetic media used by the Apple II systems is the 5 1/4-inch single-sided, double-density floppy diskette. The Apple II system can write 143 kilobytes of data to this diskette.
