Interfacing with a Printer. The Apple II systems primarily use serial printers, meaning the Apple printer interface is a serial port. The Apple II systems have two serial ports: one generally used for the printer, and the other used for communica­tion through a modem. Some serial communication boards can be used for both, and are controlled by exchanging the device interface cable and changing a switch setting on the board. It is possible to have as many serial ports as there are available expansion slots. Just like with the modem, the printer must be configured with the same data speed and size parameters that are set within the Apple II. This is because the printer must know what kind of data to expect from the computer, and then it must know what to do with the data. Printer parameters are either set through switches within the printer or on the printer controller board, and/or set through the application software being used. Check the printer's user manual to see if any switches must be set upon installa­tion. Also check the individual software documentation to see how printer pa­rameters are set up to run with that particular program. The printer is typically attached directly to the computer with an interface cable. In some cases, the printer can even be used in conjunction with the modem to provide long-range printing. A central computer from a remote site can send information via a communication line, and have it print out on a local printer.
