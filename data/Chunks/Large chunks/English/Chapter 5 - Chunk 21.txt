Problem: Misaligned Display. Sometimes the monitor display can become skewed, or it can appear com­ pressed. It can also go out of alignment (Fig. 5- 6). Follow these suggestions to check for proper alignment. Solutions: Run the Alignment Test. If the grid does not appear square and symmetrical on the screen, the monitor needs adjustment. There are adjustment potenti­ometers on the back of most monitors. These are labeled as Horizontal, Vertical, Brightness, and Contrast adjustments, and serve to deflect the electron beam or change its intensity. Use the tuning wand (do not use a metal screwdriver) to gently turn the Horizontal and Vertical potentiometers ("pots") either clockwise or coun­terclockwise to bring the screen back into alignment. Note the direction you're turning the pot, and turn only one-quarter turn at a time, so you can easily return the pot to its original position if you over-adjust. If adjusting these pots does not bring the monitor back into the proper alignment, take the monitor in for servicing. If the monitor is a television set, adjust the horizontal and vertical hold controls until the alignment grid looks straight.
