Storage Section. General-purpose system memory, performed by the ranÂ­dom-access memory (RAM) chips, stores the currently active program and the data being processed. Several RAM chips are provided on the motherboard. Computer data is read, written, and measured by a series of ON and OFF bits: 1s and Os. Eight of these ON and OFF bits constitute an Apple byte, also known as a data word or character. Most computer dimension terminology is measured in terms of bytes, particularly the amount of data that can be stored in system memory. A kilobyte is 1024 bytes. When a computer is referred to as a 128-kilobyte machine, this indicates that its system memory can store approximately 131,000 bytes at one time. The Apple lie is such a computer. On the other hand, the Apple II Plus has 48 kilobytes of system memory in RAM; while the Apple Ile has 64kB. The term random-access memory indicates that the information currently stored in the chip can be directly and immediately retrieved for the user. The physical location of the data is not a factor in retrieval time.
