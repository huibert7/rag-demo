Integrated Program Testing. When the new diagnostic program is fully integrated into the System DiagnosÂ­tic Program, a final integrated program testing phase is necessary. Carry out the same testing procedures on the new module as before. Some other bugs might crop up as a result o fbeing a part of the larger program. The two programs might interact with one another in an adverse way, and these kinds of bugs must be discovered before using the revised program for actual diagnostics. For the same reason, test all the other modules in the System Diagnostic Program. Find out whether the new program is interfering with the normal operations and integrity of the existing module. Fix any bugs found in the new diagnostic, and cycle the testing again, until no more bugs are discovered. At this point, all program development phases are finally completed. Save the newly revised program, and back it up on another diskette. The new program is now ready for actual use in a diagnostic situation.
