Chapter 2 - The System Diagnostic Program. This chapter covers the System Diagnostic Program: what subsystem modules consist of, and how to load and run the program. The Main Menu module of the System Diagnostic Program is then described in detail to explain how the pro­gram actually works. An overview on program modification and adaptation for your own purposes is covered here briefly, and treated in greater depth in Chapter 10. For those unfamiliar with Applesoft BASIC programming, or who need a quick refresher, a final section describes how to interpret the module code expla­nations provided in each chapter. This section also provides short definitions of the Applesoft BASIC statements and commands used in the System Diagnostic Program.
