Problem: A Key Doesn't "Feel" Right. As a keyboard ages, some of the more frequently used keys will begin to feel "mushy," or at least not as solid as the other keys. This is because the key springs lose tension as they age. Solutions: Call computer retailers to find keyboard springs for your keyboard. Liftoff the key cap and remove the spring from its post (Fig. 4-6). Replace the old spring with the new one, and replace the key cap. If you cannot find a replacement spring, use one from a keyboard key that is rarely used. It could be the backslash (\) key, or maybe the plus/equal sign (+/=) key.
