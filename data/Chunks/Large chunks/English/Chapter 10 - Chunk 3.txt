Developing a New Diagnostic Module. Begin considering the development of a diagnostic module for the new peri­pheral as soon as you have acquired a degree of familiarity with it. After this new device becomes an integral part of your permanent system, and not just a new toy, then it is time that its own diagnostic should be developed. The diagnostic must be developed before a malfunction occurs. If you are apprehensive about writing your own diagnostic module, particu­larly if you have never programmed before, just remember that programming is based on accomplishing a task in a very logical manner. You know where you want to go, you know what the objective is. If you don't know what you're trying to accomplish, there is no way you can write a program. First determine the tasks your program has to accomplish. Then decide what needs to be displayed on the screen. Work backwards from these objectives and determine how to complete these tasks through a program, within the constraints of BASIC commands, syntax, and formats.
