Video Controller. The Apple II video controller resides on the motherboard. These circuits control the display mode: text, low-resolution, and high-resoluÂ­tion. The character generator ROM is a part of the video controller. A series of RAM chips comprise video memory, which provide the memory locations on the screen for a character, low-res block, or high-res pixel to be displayed at a given location on the screen. A color trim resistor is also included with the video controller circuitry, allowing the adjustment of monitor color.
