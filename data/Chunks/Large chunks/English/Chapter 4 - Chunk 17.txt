Follow the instructions provided in "Running the Diagnostic Program" in Chapter 2 to run the Keyboard Diagnostic module. Then press K or k to initiate the Keyboard Diagnostic module. The Echo Test screen is displayed, together with a prompt to press the key to be echoed. Any key on the keyboard can be tested: alphanumeric keys, special character keys, and cursor keys. The keycap legend of the pressed key is displayed, along with its ASCII code value and any applicable key combination (Fig. 4-7). If a character other than the one pressed is displayed, or if no ASCII code value is displayed, then the first troubleshooting step has been accomplished: there is something wrong with the keyboard. Refer to "Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" earlier in this chapter to get the keyboard working properly again. After testing is completed, press the ESC key to return the program to the System Diagnostic Main Menu.
