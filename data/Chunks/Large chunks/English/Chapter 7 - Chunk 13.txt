Writing Data. When the user gives a save command, data currently residing in a disk buffer in system memory is written onto the magnetic emulsion of the diskette. With the magnetic drive head positioned over the proper track and sector, the data is transferred, written, and stored as tiny magnetic fields on this surface (Fig. 7- 11). A 1 data bit is magnetized in one direction on the diskette, while a 0 data bit is magnetized in another direction. A group of eight of these data bits constitutes one byte of data. Many bytes together constitute a record, or file. The floppy diskette has a method for protecting the programs and data stored there from being overwritten or erased. The diskette includes a small cutout on the side called a write-protect notch. As long as the write-protect notch is exposed, the disk drive head is able to write information onto the diskette as well as read from it (Fig. 7- 12). New boxes of diskettes always include a package of small adhesive foil tapes. When one of these tapes is placed over a diskette's write-proÂ­tect notch, the disk drive's ability to write information onto the diskette is disabled. The tape blocks the write logic sensor in the disk drive, preventing data from being written onto the diskette.
