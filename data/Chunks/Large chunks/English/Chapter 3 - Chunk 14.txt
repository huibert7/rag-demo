If you ever need to open up the system unit for troubleshooting or repair, carefully vacuum dust and dirt off the boards. Wipe the inside of the casing with a lint-free cloth moistened with isopropyl alcohol. While the system is open, dis­ connect all cables from their boards and remove oxidation from the cable con­nector pins and board edge connectors. Oxidation is caused by metal contact with air, moisture, or a combination of the two. Oxidation tarnishes the metal, and can look like either a dull gray or black film. Oxidation can form on board edge connectors and cable pins and reduce their conductivity. Oxidation can be removed by rubbing the surface with a pencil eraser (Fig. 3-5). You can also use an emery cloth, or wipe it with lint-free cloth moistened with isopropyl alcohol. The film of oxidation is visibly removed by any of these methods. After cleaning the cable pins and board edge connectors, reconnect them properly, and tighten the cable screws if applicable. If the boards are seated in slots, make sure they are aligned and completely installed in the slots for a proper connection.
