Needs Analysis. A needs analysis consists of the research and subsequent determination of the particular problems to be solved, and the tasks to be accomplished. These requireÂ­ments must be clearly defined well before any coding begins. Performing a needs analysis for a new device diagnostic module consists of: Reading the device documentation. Working with the device itself. Determining potential device problems.
