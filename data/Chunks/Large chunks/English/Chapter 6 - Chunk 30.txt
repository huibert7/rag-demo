Line Feed Test. Line feed problems are manifested by text printing on top of previous lines because the printer failed to feed a line at the proper time. The printer might jam whenever it is supposed to feed a number of lines, or go to the next page with a top-of-form command. The Line Feed Test checks the printer's vertical line spacing, and is selected by pressing 5 from the Printer Diagnostic Menu. Like the Horizontal Tab Test, this test needs no additional parameters entered, and runs as soon as it is selected. The printer types the first line. Then it gives two line feeds, types the second line, gives three line feeds, types a third line, gives four line feeds, types a fourth line, gives five line feeds, then types a fifth line. Finally a form feed command is issued, and the printer rolls up to the next page and prints a line (Fig. 6-12). Line spacing and form feeding are often controlled by switch settings. If the results are unsatisfactory, refer to "Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" in the previous section for more information.
