However, the memory of the RAM chips is volatile. Volatile means that when power is removed from the computer, all programs and data stored in RAM are cleared. When the computer is powered on again, the RAM is empty, and the required software and data must be once again loaded into RAM from a mass storage device such as a disk drive or cassette tape drive. RAM is used as tempoÂ­rary storage for programs and data while the system is powered-on.
