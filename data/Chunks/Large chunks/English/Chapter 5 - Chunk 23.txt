Problem: Display Pages Do Not Scroll Properly. When the screen is completely filled with text and you enter more characters on the next line, the entire screen display moves up, pushing the top line off the screen, making place for the next line. This is called scrolling. If the display does not move up, but rather fills one screen and then overwrites at the bottom of the screen, the monitor has a scrolling problem. Run the Scroll Test to check this. If the display does not scroll properly, then there is a problem with the display section of the system unit. Refer to Chapter 3 on how to troubleshoot the system unit.
