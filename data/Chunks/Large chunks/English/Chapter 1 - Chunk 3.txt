System Unit. The system unit is the actual computer, and as such, is the single most impor­tant component of the computer system. On the Apple II systems, the system unit is enclosed in the same assembly with the keyboard. The system unit houses the central processing unit (CPU), as well as the various interfaces for the computer's peripherals. The CPU consists of the microprocessor chip that runs the computer. It issues commands that cause calculations to be made and processes to be run as well as coordinating the various input and output devices. It transfers and processes data to and from the outside world via ports. The CPU microprocessor chip resides on the motherboard, as do the video, cassette drive, and game paddle controllers. The various versions of the Apple II system - the II Plus, IIe, and IIc - have different CPU configurations. The Apple II Plus system unit microprocessor consists of the 6502 CPU chip with 48 kilobytes of memory. It also includes eight expansion slots for additional peripheral boards such as a disk drive controller or serial communication inter­face board. The system unit microprocessor for the Apple IIe includes the 6502B CPU chip, and 64 kilobytes of memory. Like the II Plus, the Apple IIe has eight expansion slots. The Apple IIc uses the 65C02 microprocessor with 128 kilobytes of memory. The IIc is contained in a different housing than the II Plus and IIe systems. The case itself is smaller and more compact. There are two serial I/O ports for a printer and modem, a mouse interface, and two disk drive controllers: one for an internal drive, and one for an external drive.
