In addition to the advantages of speed, the dot-matrix printer is attractive because of its ability to produce an unlimited number of character font styles and point sizes. Certain dot-matrix printers, called graphic printers, can render graphic charac足ters. The Apple ImageWriter is an example of such a graphic printer. A graphic printer can address just as many ink points (which correspond to the monitor's pixels) as your monitor resolution can display. It can reproduce graphic charac足ters, as well as drawings and business graphics. Any shape can be created with a series of dots. This makes the dot-matrix printer highly flexible as to the output that can be created. There are also dot-matrix printers that can print in different colors. The major difference lies in the printer using multicolored ribbon. The ImageWriter, Pana足sonic, and several other popular printers have multicolored printer ribbons avail足able for their printers.
