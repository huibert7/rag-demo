System Flowchart. Creating the system flowchart is the first stage of program analysis and flowcharting. The system flowchart expresses the fundamental ideas of the program. The general order in which the program will flow to attain the desired results is abstracted in this flowchart. The system flowchart also lists the intermediate functions to be carried out. This technique lets you think out the program as a whole without being concerned about more specific details, such as where loops and branches need to occur. Figure 10-3 is an example of a system flowchart for a simple program segment asking users to enter their name, and then greeting them by name.
