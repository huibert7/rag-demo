A value can be read by a BASIC program that can be related to a position on the screen. In order to develop a tracking test like this, determine how information is sent from the game paddle to the system unit, and how this information is accessed. This is a relatively simple process. The position of the wheel can be determined by the `PDL` BASIC instruction, which returns a value from 0 (exÂ­treme left) t o 255 (extreme right) . This value can be used to arithmetically derive a value between 1 and 40, representing the number of columns on a low-resolution graphics screen display. The derived value can then be used for positioning the indicator block along the diagnostic gauge. A continuous loop in the program can let the diagnostic continuously check whether this value has been changed, meaning that the game paddle has been moved. If the pointer fails to track along the gauge, or if the tracking is incorrect or inconsistent, refer to "Game Paddle Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" above for solutions to this problem.
