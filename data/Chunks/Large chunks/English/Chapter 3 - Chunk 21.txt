Problem: System Has Crashed. When the Apple II system is powered on, Applesoft BASIC is automatically loaded from ROM. A successful load is indicated by a right bracket (]) prompt on the screen. If the screen suddenly clears and is replaced by a series of hexadecimal numbers, and if the right bracket prompt changes to an asterisk (*) prompt, this indicates that the system has just crashed and placed the computer in the machine monitor program environment. Solution: To recover from the crash, press RESET or CTRL RESET. The environment returns to Applesoft BASIC as indicated by the right bracket prompt. This is a simple solution, but, unfortunately, work stored in system memÂ­ory at the time of the crash is probably lost. To prevent losing work due to a system crash (or power outage, for that matter), save your work to disk about every ten minutes. If you were working within a language other than BASIC, you might need to reload the language board. If pressing RESET does not return the computer to the Applesoft BASIC environment, turn the computer off, wait a few seconds, and then turn it on again. If the system still does not access the Applesoft BASIC environment with the right bracket prompt, this indicates a more serious problem. The BASIC ROM chip might have blown, and this chip will need to be replaced.
