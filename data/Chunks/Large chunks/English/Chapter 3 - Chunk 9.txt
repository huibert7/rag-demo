Controllers and Ports. The different Apple II systems have different combinations of device conÂ­troller circuits, ports, and expansion slots on the motherboard. All three systems include the following controllers on the motherboard: Monitor controller. Keyboard controller. Cassette drive controller. Game paddle controller. These controllers exist as separate circuits on the motherboard, each with its appropriate external connector with which to connect the monitor, keyboard, cassette drive, and game paddle (Fig. 3-3).
