ASCII values also represent control functions like SHIFT, CTRL, cursor movement, special characters, and symbols. The Apple II systems recognize 128 such ASCII code values. Directly related to the ASCII code is the character string value, or CHR$ code. The CHR$ code value is often used in BASIC programs to access a particular symbol or function that is not directly accessible from the keyboard. For examÂ­ple, on the Apple II, the BASIC command PRINT CHR$(61) displays the lowercase "a". If you were to examine the code listings for the System Diagnostic Program, you would see several instances in which a CHR$ value is invoked. Because CHR$ and ASCII values are related to one another on a one-to-one basis, CHR$(61) and ASCII 61 both represent the lowercase "a". The difference between the uses of the two code value schemes is that CHR$ is used to invoke letters and functions within a BASIC program, while ASCII is used for processing of keyboard input in the CPU. The ASCII value is also used to convert (using the BASIC ASC instruction) numeric string numbers into numeric values that can be used as such.
