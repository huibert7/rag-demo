Other general troubleshooting techniques include reseating controller boards, cleaning oxidation from cable pins and board edge connectors, and checking switch settings. Procedures for each of these are covered in Chapter 3, under "System Unit Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines." Each subsystem chapter that follows lists several more specific solutions to try when troubleshooting a problem. When you've tried everything and the problem still is not fixed, the problem is probably in the system unit itself. If the above system unit measures do not effect a repair, that's when it's finally time to take the computer in for servicing.
