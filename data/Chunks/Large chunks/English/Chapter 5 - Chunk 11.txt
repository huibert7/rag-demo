The Monitor Interface. When using a television as the monitor, the composite cable with the round single-pin RCA phono jack is used to create the monitor interface between the two RF converters. On the Apple side, there is the built-in RF converter inside the system unit. On the television side, the RF converter connects to the VHF antenna terminals. The composite cable connects between the two RF converters to form the television monitor interface. The RF converter receives the computer's digital signals and converts them into the analog signals required by the television.
