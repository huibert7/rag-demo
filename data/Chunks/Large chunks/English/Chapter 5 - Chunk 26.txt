Problem: Missing High-Resolution Location. If you're running a game or application, such as a spreadsheet or graphics program, that uses the high-resolution graphics mode, and certain characters, or a part of the background appears to have tiny dark spots in them, then there are pixels missing due to a problem with the high-resolution memory locations. Try the following solution. Solution: Run the High-Resolution Test Program, the HIRES program on the diagÂ­nostic diskette, but separate from the System Diagnostic Program. This test checks all high-resolution memory locations. If no blank spots are revealed by running the High-Resolution Test, the problem is not with the monitor, but with the software you were using when the blanks occurred. If any part of the screen is blank instead of filled, then there is a problem with the high-resolution memory locations as controlled by one of the RAM chips. Each RAM chip is labeled RAM beside its socket on the floor of the motherboard. Unplug your system, open it up, and carefully remove one of the RAMs using a chip extractor (refer to "Working with IC Chips" in Chapter 1 ). Take the chip to an electronics supply store and buy one or two exact replacements. Replace the new RAM in the original socket, and check if the problem is still present. If the location is still blank, unplug your system again, open it up, and replace the old RAM in its original socket. Remove a different RAM and replace it with the new one. Turn the system on again and check for the problem. Continue in this manner, shotgunning the bank of RAM chips until the malfunctioning location is present once again. If the character location remains blank after replacing all the RAMS, take the motherboard in for servicing.
