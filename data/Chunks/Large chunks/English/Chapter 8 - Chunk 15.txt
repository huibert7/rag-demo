Baud Rate. Baud rate pertains to how fast the device sends information. The device receiving the data must know the speed at which the data are being sent in order for the two devices to be in sync with one another. In serial communication, speed is expressed in a measurement called baud. Baud is usually, although not always, the number of bits that can be transmitted in a second. The differences in baud rates can be likened to the different ways a car horn might be sounded. Three short beeps can be heard much faster than three long beeps. In the same way, eight bits of data traveling at 2400 baud are transmitted and received at a much faster rate than the same eight bits traveling at 300 baud. When the baud rate is set to a predetermined speed of which both devices are aware, the system knows how long each ON bit lasts, and how long each OFF bit lasts. A typical communication interface for the Apple II has a baud rate of 300 or 1200. Higher speed communication in the range of 4800 and 9600 baud is available, but is used primarily for communicating with devices that are hard-wired to a system through an interface cable. A hard-wire interface does not require an intermediary such as a modem in order to establish communication. A printer or computer that is hard-wired to another computer is able to operate at the faster speeds. There are modems available that can operate at such high speeds, but they can be prohibitively expensive to the small business or home user.
