Program Flowchart. The program flowchart is based on the system flowchart, but is far more detailed. Following the order and task listing detailed by the system flowchart, the program flowchart actually charts the inputs, branches, decisions, loops, and other structural details of the program. It is the implemenÂ­tation of the system flowchart. While the system flowchart lists the necessary tasks to achieve a desired goal, the program flowchart shows specifically how these tasks will be completed in the program. Figure 10-4 shows the program flowchart based on the system flowchart shown in Fig. 10-3. If your design of the device diagnostic module includes more than one test, you will probably have several system flowcharts, representing each of the sub-module tests. Create a separate program flowchart for each of the separate system flowcharts. When these are all completed, connect all the flowcharts together in the order required to create one flowchart for the entire device diagnostic module.
