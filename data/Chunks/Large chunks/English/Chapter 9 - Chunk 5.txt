Checking for the Original Problem. Before accepting and paying for a repair, have the repair technician demonÂ­strate that the problem has been repaired. While still at the shop, try the system out for yourself. This can save a lot of time, especially if the problem has not been fixed after all, or if there was an original miscommunication of the problem. After the unit is back in place, securely cable the entire system together. Make sure the entire system is operating as normal. Recreate the situation that originally caused the problem. This might consist of running a particular software program, or going through a specific sequence of events in a certain environment. If the problem does not occur now, then the problem has most certainly been repaired.
