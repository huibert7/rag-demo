Directionality. Depending on the device with which the Apple II is communi­cating, the data might be sent in one direction only, or the data might be sent in both directions - to and from both devices. Printers are unidirectional devices, meaning they only receive data; they cannot transmit data back to the computer. On the other hand, when two computers are linked up through modems, the data is said to be bidirectional, since data can be sent to and received by each system. Whether the data is unidirectional or bidirectional depends on the type of device the data is sending to as well as the software being used for the communica­tion transfer. Some system configuration parameters in the support software might need to be set. There might also be switches to set on the serial communica­tion interface board. This would be detailed in the device documentation.
