Interface Port. The serial communication interface board has a connector into which a cable is attached. This connection is where the functional signals and data are passed across the interface, one bit at a time, between the two communicating devices. The serial communication interface transmits seven or eight bits of data se­quentially, in serial form. These signals ensure that both machines are synchro­nized with one another, and are prepared to receive or send data. They also help detect breaks in the communication line and other communication errors, and return error signals to the programs when necessary. The RS-232 serial communication standard determines what these functional signals consist of, and which cable wires are assigned to carry which types of signal or data.
