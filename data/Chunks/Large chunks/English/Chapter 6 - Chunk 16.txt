Problem: Poor Print Quality. Another printer problem can result in poor print image quality. Though the characters are recognizable, they look blurred, light, or washed out. A related problem can occur when printing on a multiple copy form. In this instance, while the top copy prints well, subsequent copies print poorly or not at all. Solutions: Run the Sliding Alpha or Display Print Character Test of the Printer DiagÂ­nostic program to obtain sample output. Poor print quality is usually a mechanical rather than a software problem. Check the printer ribbon. It might be jammed, or spent. When this happens, the print heads strike the same place on the ribbon, and the ribbon is unable to advance to fresh ink. Manually advance the ribbon with the advance knob on the cartridge, or install a new ribbon cartridge. Some printers have a forms adjustment, which enables the print head to be brought further back from the carriage to accommodate papers of heavier thicknesses, or multi-part forms. Use the forms adjustment to move the head closer to the carriage. Run the print sample and adjust the head until the print image is clear and sharp. Clean the letter-quality daisy wheel, or the dot-matrix print head, with a lint-free cloth or cotton swab moistened with isopropyl alcohol. If the print quality is still unacceptable after changing the ribbon, adjusting the print head, and cleaning the element, refer to the printer documentation. Call the manufacturer for more information.
