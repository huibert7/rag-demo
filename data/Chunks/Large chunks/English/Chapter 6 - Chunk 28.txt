Echo Character Print Test. The Echo Character Print Test prints, or echos, an entered character across all 80 or 132 columns of the printer. This test ensures that a certain character is printing, and if it is, it lets you check its appearance, making sure it's a complete character, and that it's not broken or faded. This test also lets you check whether all columns along the printer carriage are accepting characters. Press 3 to run the Echo Character Print Test. You will be prompted to enter the character to be echoed. Function keys and cursor keys are disabled for this test. Only valid character keys can be echoed. The printer prints this character at all positions along the carriage, columns 1 through 80 (Fig. 6- 10). When it's finished, press any other character to have that character echoed. After you press the ESC key, the Printer Diagnostic Menu will be displayed once again.
