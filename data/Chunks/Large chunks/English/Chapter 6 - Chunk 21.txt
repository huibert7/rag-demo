Problem: Installing a New Printer. The majority of printer problems occur during initial printer installation. This is because there are several variables that must be taken into account when installing a new printer. For instance, you might have been printing to a dot-matrix printer with no problems. The day may come when you decide to obtain a letter-quality printer. You disconnect the old printer and connect the new printer to the Apple, and think you're finished. But upon running an application and attempting to print the results, you discover that either the printer does not print at all, or that there are incorrect results. The reason this happens is that as far as the Apple II system is concerned, the new printer is a completely foreign device. It is not addressable, therefore, the computer and new printer do not know how to effectively communicate with one another. Particular rules, or protocols must be followed in order for the various system components to communicate with one another and send data back and forth. The protocols that the original printer understood may be quite different from the protocols that the new printer requires.
