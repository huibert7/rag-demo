The dot-matrix printer provides very quick output, and is the least expensive printer type available. Speed is measured in characters per second (cps), referring to how fast the printer can place characters on paper. A dot-matrix printer can range in speed from 30 to 200+ cps. The wide range of possible speeds is attributed to several factors, including the speed at which the computer can feed data to the printer; whether the printer interface is a serial or parallel connection; whether there is a printer buffer; the number of dots used to create a character; and whether a printer is unidirectional or bidirectional.
