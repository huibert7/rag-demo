After this is completed, the program loops back and tests the monitor again, then the printer, and so forth. The Exerciser runs in this continuous loop, running the tests in a repeated cycle. If all three subsystems are included in the Exerciser, one cycle takes approximately 25 minutes, with 20 of those minutes devoted to the disk drive portion of the test. Press `CTRL RESET` to halt the Exerciser. This ends the System Exerciser module, and as a result, halts the entire System Diagnostic Program. To return to the Exerciser, enter `GOTO 4300` at the Applesoft BASIC right bracket prompt. The system returns to the System Diagnostic Program at line 4300 in the code. At this point, a message is displayed indicating the number of passes the program has completed. The system then prompts to enter any character to end the diagnostic. Once this is done, the System Diagnostic Program displays the System Diagnostic Main Menu.
