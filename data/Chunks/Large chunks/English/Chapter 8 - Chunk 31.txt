Problem: Serial Comm Interface Needs to Be Serviced. If the solutions described above fail to solve the serial communication prob足lem, and the system requires servicing, first call the Apple II service center and speak with the technician. Describe the computer configuration, type of modem, and the problem. Explain the troubleshooting measures you have already taken, and the results. Ask if the technician can suggest any additional solutions over the phone. If the unit still needs to be taken in, ask the technician how much of the system should be brought. The technician will probably need the system unit, interface, modem, and cable. When speaking with the technician, provide all available information. Find out if the technician has any ideas on what the problem might be, and how long and how much it might cost to fix. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before you pay and accept your system, have the repair technician demon足strate that the problem has actually been repaired. Then pack the system up and carefully take it home. Connect everything together, run the Serial Communica足tion Interface Diagnostic module to make sure it's working. Then refer to Chap足ter 9, "The Exerciser," for instructions on burning in the system after repair.
