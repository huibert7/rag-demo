Spares. Professional technicians usually have an inventory of spare parts associated with the equipment they work on. The spares help them in troubleshooting, when they swap out parts to find out whether or not it was that component that was causing the problem. If the replacement solves the problem, then they know that the old part was defective. In your case, however, maintaining your own inventory of spare parts for the Apple II could be costly and impractical. An alternative is to find someone (a friend, a colleague at work, an acquaintance in a user group) who owns the same type of Apple II system. Work out a deal with this person in which you can temporarily swap parts with each other when one of your systems is malfunction­ing. You can use this person's system for troubleshooting by temporarily swap­ ping suspect parts to find exactly where the problem is.
