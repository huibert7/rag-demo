Use a hand-held vacuum cleaner or, if necessary, a can of compressed air to vacuum or blow around the keyboard keys. This removes any dust and dirt that has gotten into the keyboard in spite of the dust cover. If you have to remove a keycap for a repair take the opportunity to clean the inside of the keycap with a cotton swab moistened with denatured isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Clean the key contact with spray contact cleaner. These cleaning measures will prevent future problems with that key.
