**Television Set**. The Apple II series computers, like many home computers, can use a television set as its display monitor. An external radio frequency (RF) converter is attached to the television via the television's VHF antenna leads. If your television is cable-ready, a coaxial cable connector can be used instead of the antenna leads. The Apple II cable attaches from the internal RF converter (Fig. 5-2) to an RF converter on the television using a composite video cable. The television RF converter includes a switch to choose between using the television as a computer monitor (COMPUTER) and using the television to view broadÂ­ casts (TV). The television channel selection must also be set to channel 33 when working with the Apple II.

The television set monitor can display graphics and color, but only in the 40 x 24 text format (as contrasted with the 80 x 24 text format on a standard computer monitor).

The low-resolution graphics mode divides the screen into a matrix of 40 x 48 blocks. Each of these blocks can be assigned one of the 16 available colors, and can draw low-resolution graphics.
