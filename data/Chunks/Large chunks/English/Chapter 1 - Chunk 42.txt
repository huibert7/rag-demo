Working With Tools. Always make sure you're using the proper tool for the job at hand. Don't try to force one tool to do another tool's job for the sake of convenience. You'll end up making more work for yourself, because fittings can break and screws can be stripped, making them useless. Use the proper screw­ driver size for the screw. Use flatblade screwdrivers for slotted-head screws, and Phillips screwdrivers for Phillips-head screws (Fig. 1-5). When making adjust­ments on one of the printed circuit boards, use a tuning wand instead of a metal screwdriver. This prevents electrical components from accidental shorting or bridging. Electrical shorts between components can cause serious damage to a circuit.
