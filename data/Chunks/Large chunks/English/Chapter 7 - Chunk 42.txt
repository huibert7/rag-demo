If there is a discrepancy between what was written and what is now being read, an error is noted and added to the counter. The total number of errors is displayed on the screen at the end of the test. After the second pass of the test is finished, the file will be closed and deleted. The third pass recreates the file, this time with a series of 254-character records of CHR$ value 63, which has a bit string of 00011111 , opposite of the CHR$ value 64 done in the previous pass. The diagnostic writes 239 records of this value to fill the disk again. The message "WRITING LOW VALUES TO DISK" is displayed for approximately five minutes. When the diskette is full, again, the file is closed. Because CHR$(63) and CHR$(64) have an alternating bit pattern, this ensures that all possible bits on the disk are written, creating a thorough test of the disk.
