The System Exerciser. Chapter 9 covers the System Exerciser Module, which burns in and thoroughly tests the system when it is new, or after a repair. All system functions are exercised and run continuously with the Exerciser. This is much like test-driving your car after a repair. The Exerciser checks whether your computer has an inherent problem, or whether your problem has indeed been repaired as expected. Your computer is a system of many interrelated components, and as such, when something goes wrong in one part of the computer, it might actually be caused by something in another part of your computer. The Exerciser Module of the System Diagnostic Program ensures that the system as a whole is working properly.
