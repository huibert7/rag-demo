Horizontal Tab Test. The Horizontal Tab Test checks all combinations of tabbing across the printer carriage. Press 4 to run the Horizontal Tab Test. The printer prints an asterisk at column 1, feeds a line, tabs to column 2, prints an asterisk, feeds a line, tabs to column 3, prints an asterisk, and so on all the way through to column 80. In this way, every horizontal tab position is checked. The printed result is a diagonal line of asterisks running from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner of the paper (Fig. 6-11). If you do not obtain such results, there is a problem with the printer mecha­nism, or the printer might need a switch setting changed. Refer to "Trouble­ shooting and Repair Guidelines" earlier in this chapter for further information.
