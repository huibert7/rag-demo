The Serial Communication Interface Port. The serial interface port on the Apple II Plus and IIe is a RS-232 25-pin connector located at the rear of the Apple II system unit. Although there are 25 pins, only 5 of these pins are used for serial communication signals, with pin assignments as follows: Pin 2 - TRANSMIT DATA (output). Pin 3 - READ DATA (input). Pin 6 - DATA SET READY (input). Pin 7 - POWER AND SIGNAL COMMON (ground). Pin 20 - DATA TERMINAL READY (output). The 20 remaining connector pins are not used. The serial interface port on the Apple IIc is more efficient, using an actual RS-232 5-pin connector. Its pin assignments are as follows: 1 - DATA TERMINAL READY (output). 2 - TRANSMIT DATA (output). 3 - POWER AND SIGNAL COMMON (ground). 4 - READ DATA (input). 5 - DATA SET READY (input).
