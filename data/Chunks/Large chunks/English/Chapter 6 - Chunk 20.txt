Problem: Certain Characters Do Not Print Completely. A particular dot-matrix printer problem is that while all the characters print, they do not print completely. In this case, it would not be just one or two individual characters that have this problem, but the entire character set. Only part of the "a", "r", or "m", might be displayed, and the same segment of the character is missing in each of the characters, for example, upper left, or lower right. Solutions: First check the ribbon. It might be folded down or spent. Replace the ribbon and run the Sliding Alpha or Display Character Print Test to obtain sample output. If the ribbon is in good condition, then there is a problem in the print head. One of the solenoids that actuates the dot matrix pins in the head has probably malfunctioned or worn out. Take the printer in for servicing, and ask to have the faulty solenoid repaired or replaced.
