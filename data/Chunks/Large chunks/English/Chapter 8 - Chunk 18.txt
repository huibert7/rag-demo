Parity. Parity is an error checking scheme used to ensure accurate data trans­ mission. With parity, the last bit in a data word is set so that the sum of the number of bits is either an odd number, for odd parity, or an even number, for even parity. For example, if the system is configured for odd parity from the modem to the computer, and a character or word is received with an even number of bits, parity is not correct. This might mean that one of the character bits was lost during transmission. When parity is not achieved, this indicates an error in transmission. In this case, the communication software gives a prompt to try the data transmis­sion again, or it restarts automatically.
