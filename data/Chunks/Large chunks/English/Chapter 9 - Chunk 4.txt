Testing the Apple II System. There are three aspects to testing the Apple II system when it is new, or when it returns from repair: Checking for the original problem. Running the subsystem diagnostic module. Burning in the system as a whole with the System Exerciser. This section describes these three aspects of testing, and suggests what should be done if testing reveals a problem. Adhering to this testing sequence and following these suggestions will ensure system integrity. It will also help prevent the loss of any programs, data, and time when actual work is performed on the recently repaired system.
