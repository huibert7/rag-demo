Integration. The integration phase consists of appending the program code to an existing program, in this case the System Diagnostic Program, and making sure that the two programs work together harmoniously without adversely interfering with one another. Integration also consists of editing lines of code so that the two programs are intermeshed, using each other's resources and subroutines, and referring appropriate parts of one program to parts of the other so that they work together as one cohesive program. When you insert the new module into the System Diagnostic Program, modify lines 50 through 190 of the program where the Main Menu module resides. Add the module's title and identifier to the PRINT statement that lists the menu options on the screen. Also, insert the appropriate IF statement for the new module so that the program branches to the proper line number where the new code begins. Once this is done, add the code to the program. Have the line numbers of the new code begin around 6000, or wherever the last diagnostic module stopped.
