Types of Printers. There are many printers available compatible with the Apple II systems. Most Apple II printers use a serial interface connector, although some printer conÂ­trollers include an on-board parallel interface. The two basic types of Apple II printer choices consist of the dot-matrix printer and the letter-quality printer. Laser printers are also available for the Apple II, but they are not covered in this book.
