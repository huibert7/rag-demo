When a bug is found, see if it is repeatable. Then try out other variations of this action to see if it causes the same result. This will provide you with more information on how to fix the bug. Make notes on the program listing, such as the lines where you think the bug might exist, and possible solutions. After you have sufficient information about the bug, list the code and edit the appropriate lines. It may be necessary to do additional research to find out why the problem is happening in the first place, and to get ideas on possible solutions. When you believe the bug is fixed, try the program out again. Go through the same sequence of events that lead up to the bug occurring, and see whether it happens again. Try all the different values and combinations imaginable. When finally satisfied that the bug is fixed in this particular place, try all the other functions with different values and combinations as well. Often fixing a bug will create another bug.
