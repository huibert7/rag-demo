Problem: I/O Error Message. If an I/O Error message displays when you're trying to access the disk drive, then there are a number of different disk drive read-write problems. It might mean that the diskette is defective, write-protected, not initialized, or not even present. The error message might also mean that the drive is not able to locate the identifying header portion of a sector that the system is trying to access. It could indicate that the drive cannot find the synchronization marker for the track the system is trying to access. Solutions: First check the diskette. See that there is a diskette present in the drive. Make certain that the disk drive door is closed. Remove the diskette from the drive, and check whether or not the write-proÂ­tect notch is covered with an adhesive write-protect tape. If it is, remove the tape and insert the diskette into the drive again. The system should now be able to write information onto the diskette. However, remember that you probably originally placed the write-protect tape on the diskette in order to protect data already written on the diskette. Make sure that the system does not overwrite valuable data or programs, now that the diskette is write-enabled.
