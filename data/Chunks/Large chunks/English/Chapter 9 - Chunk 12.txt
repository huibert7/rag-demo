Running the System Exerciser. When you are ready to run the System Exerciser on the Apple II, make sure that the components are ready for hours of testing. If the printer is part of the test, load it with a sufficient quantity of continuous form paper. Check that there is enough ribbon to last throughout the duration of the printer test. Blank, formatted diskettes should be inserted into each of the drives being tested. Although you might wish to dim the monitor display, there is no danger from etching (see Chapter 5 for more information about etching}, because the display is continuously changing. To run the System Exerciser, follow the instructions provided in "Running the Diagnostic Program" in Chapter 2. Then from the System Diagnostic Main Menu, press E to initiate the Exerciser module. The screen will clear and a prompt will ask you if the monitor is to be tested, yes or no. Enter Y or N and press RETURN.
