There is usually a notch or dot on the chip as well as on the socket to help with alignment orientation when inserting a chip onto the socket. Have the notches of the chip and socket facing the same direction (Fig. 1-8). Carefully line the IC chip pins up with the socket holes, then gently press the chip into the socket as far as it will go. Be sure not to bend the IC pins while you're pressing it into the socket. This could render the chip useless. If the chip needing replacement is soldered onto the PC board, take the board in to computer service. Soldering is a skill that takes a lot of practice, so have the professionals do it.
