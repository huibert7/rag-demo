Troubleshooting Techniques. Troubleshooting is another word for problem-solving. When there is a comÂ­puter malfunction, troubleshooting is a systematic approach with which you can discover what caused the problem so that you can effect a repair. When a subsystem or even the entire computer isn't working, check the easy things first, such as items having to do with power and cabling. Does it have power? Are all power switches turned to the ON position? Is the unit plugged into an AC supply? Is the AC supply controlled by a light switch? Is the AC supply controlled by a power strip switch? Is the fuse blown? Is there a problem in the fuse box or circuit breaker? Are the cables properly seated?
