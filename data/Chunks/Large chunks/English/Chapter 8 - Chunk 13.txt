Communication Software. In order to use the serial communication interface, communication software that works from the serial communication interface is needed. An example of this kind of software is a modem communication proÂ­gram. Most modems come supplied with communication software. The same is true for the mouse and other serial communication devices you might acquire. Some available serial communication boards do not require separate software. DIP-switches let you set communication parameters, and special programs built into the board's ROMs provide communication command sets to perform all necessary communication software functions.
