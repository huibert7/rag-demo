Problem: Communication Results Are Garbled. Garbled, confused, or miscommunicated data indicates that communication has been established, but there's a problem with the data coming through the lines. This usually has to do with one of the parameter settings such as the word size or parity. Access the communication software parameter setup mode again, and check all the settings. A mixture of garbled characters and good characters indicates a poor teleÂ­ phone connection. For example, the other computer might send the word "login", but "loxxn" is received. In this case, hang up and redial.
