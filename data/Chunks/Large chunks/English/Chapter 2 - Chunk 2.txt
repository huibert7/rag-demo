SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM SUMMARY. The System Diagnostic Program is divided into several modules. Each module includes the necessary program instructions for exercising a particular device on the Apple II and testing for possible problems. The devices that can be tested with this program are those of a typical configuration: keyboard, monitor, disk drive, printer, and serial communication interface. The block diagram in Fig. 2-1 outlines the structure of the System Diagnostic Program. The numbers within each of the blocks are the line numbers where the code for that subsystem module is located. Lines 10 through 30 are set aside for introductory program remarks.
