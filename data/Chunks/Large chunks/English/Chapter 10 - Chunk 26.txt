Developing the Game Paddle Diagnostic Module. Up to this point, development of a new device diagnostic module has been treated in generalized terms. Provided in this section is a concrete example to make the development process clearer. This example uses the game paddle as the new peripheral for which a diagnostic module will be developed. The step-by-step process includes researching the functions and potential problems of the game paddle, designing the flowcharts for the Game Paddle Diagnostic, developing and testing the new code, and finally integrating and testing the new program as a new module in the System Diagnostic Program. Between the general principles outlined in the previous section and the conÂ­crete examples described in this section, you should be able to gain a good understanding of how a diagnostic module can be developed for any peripheral added to your Apple II system.
