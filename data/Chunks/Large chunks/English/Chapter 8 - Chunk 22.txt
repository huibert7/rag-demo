Another protocol used by modems to establish communication is called the handshaking protocol . A series of signals is used to establish modem communication. The following is a listing of the handshaking protocol, including the proceÂ­dure and data signals used to establish and maintain communication. Notice that some of the signals, such as Carrier Detect, Request to Send, and Clear to Send, are used only by the modem, and do not go through the serial communication interface itself. 1 - Load and run the communication program. The modem issues the TR signal (Terminal Ready). 2 - Dial the phone to call the other modem and computer system. The modem switches into the data mode and issues the DSR signal (Data Set Ready). 3 - The other system answers and responds. The CD (Carrier Detect) is issued, and the corresponding light is illuminated on the modem panel. 4 - Press a key to begin sending a character code to the other system. The RTS (Request to Send) signal is sent from the computer to the modem, and the appropriate light is illuminated. 5 - The modem transmits a signal back to the computer to indicate that it is prepared to accept data for transmission. The CTS (Clear to Send) signal is received.. 6 - The data is sent. The SD (SendData) light is illuminated on the modem.
