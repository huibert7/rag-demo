When professional software developers create a new software program, they have specific methods which help them determine the objectives of a program. These methods help them design and finally write the program so that it success­ fully meets the original objectives and accomplishes the necessary tasks. It is not a haphazard method with programmers quickly brainstorming about a new kind of program and immediately writing code. Rather, programming is an extremely logical process in which well-developed detail and organization skills are neces­sary for success. The process of developing a program includes the following phases: Needs analysis. System design. Program analysis (flowcharting). Program preparation (coding). Module testing. Integration. Integrated program testing. Professional software developed in a corporate environment, can have a devel­opment cycle lasting from three months to two years. However, a module con­sisting of simple diagnostic routines might only take a few days. Nonetheless, each development phase is necessary for a good program that accomplishes its objectives. People have been successfully programming computers in this man­ner for almost forty years.
