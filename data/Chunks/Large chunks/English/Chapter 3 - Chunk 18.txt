Problem: Oxidation Needs to Be Removed. If there is a problem with the system unit, but it is receiving sufficient power, then a dirty connection causing ineffective contact might be indicated. Try the following solution. Solution: Remove oxidation from the expansion board edge connectors and cable pins. To do this: Power off the system. Disconnect the power supply (if it is a IIe system). Disconnect all attached peripheral devices (cassette drive, disk drive, printer, monitor, game paddle, etc.). Remove the top cover to open the system unit (Fig. 3-6). Remove the cable connector from each expansion board one at a time, and check the cable pins for oxidation - the gray or black film on the metal. If there is oxidation, remove it with a pencil eraser, emery cloth, or lint-free cloth moistened with isopropyl alcohol. Remove the expansion board from the slot (refer to"Working with PC Boards" in Chapter 1 for further instructions on handling printed cirÂ­cuit boards). Check the edge connector for oxidation, and remove it if necessary. Insert the expansion board back in the slot, and reconnect its cable. Go on to the next expansion board. Repeat the process of cleaning oxidation from the cable pins and edge connectors. Close the system unit, reconnect the power supply and monitor, and power-on the system unit.
