The Exerciser begins with the monitor diagnostics, then goes to the printer diagnostics, and finally to the disk drive diagnostics. When complete, the Exer­ciser cycles back to the monitor to repeat the process. This cycle continues until the `CTRL RESET` is pressed to interrupt the Exerciser. Upon interruption, the message, "TOTAL PASSES THROUGH EXERCISER-X", is displayed to indi­cate the number of cycles the Exerciser has run. Because the Exerciser tests the three major components of the Apple II system: the monitor, printer, and disk drive(s}, it can indicate whether there is a system problem. If it's an obvious problem, it will probably surface immediately. If there is a marginal or intermittent problem elsewhere in the system, it will show up within a 12-hour bum-in run of the Exerciser. The System Exerciser module operates under BASIC, like the rest of the System Diagnostic Program. Because of this, the Exerciser is also testing an extensive section of the system unit's machine instructions through BASIC, which is written in the CPU machine language.
