Problem: A Key Sticks When Pressed. A sticking key stays down after being pressed, causing its character to fill up the whole screen until you physically lift the key up again. There are three remedies for this type of problem. Solutions: Use the key extractor to lift the key cap off. Then spray contact cleaner on the key post as described above. This removes dust and dirt that might be obstructing the free movement of the key. If the key still sticks after being pressed, remove the key cap again, and use a small metal file to lightly file the edges of the key cap itself (Fig. 4-5). This increases the distance between the key and key case so that the keycap can move up and down more freely.
