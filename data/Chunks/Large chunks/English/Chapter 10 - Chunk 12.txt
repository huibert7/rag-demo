Flowcharting Symbols. Although there are numerous flowcharting symbols in existence, only five are needed for the purposes of charting a device diagnostic program. As shown in Fig. 10-1 , these symbols are: Terminal. Input/Output. Processing. Decision. Connector. The oblong terminal symbol represents the beginning and end of a program. The parallelogram input/output symbol represents any I/O function. This can include input data to be read into the CPU, and output information to be displayed on the screen or sent to the printer. The rectangular processing symbol represents computer processing operaÂ­tions. Arithmetic and data movement instructions are typical of the types of steps included in the processing symbols.
