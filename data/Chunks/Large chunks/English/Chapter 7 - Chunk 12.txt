Locating and Grouping Data. When data is being written, the timing and synchronization hole on the diskette is used as a location reference point. This hole marks the starting point for information to be written onto the diskette. The disk drive controller knows the locations and contents of each group of data stored on the diskette . When the controller receives a read or write command from the CPU, it locates the required data, and directs the head to the proper place for reading. The diskette, like a phonograph record or a compact laser disk, stores specific information in specific areas. For example, just as the phonograph record stores different songs on different tracks, a diskette stores information on various tracks and sectors. The diskette is divided into a series of concentric circles, with each circle being one track. There are 35 tracks on the Apple II 143-kilobyte disk drive (Fig. 7-9). When the diskette is formatted, each track is divided into sectors (Fig. 7- 10). Each Apple II disk sector contains 256 bytes. In any read or write operaÂ­tion, exactly one sector's worth of information is located and transferred. The program may need to manipulate only 20 bytes of that sector, but the computer always transfers all the information in the entire sector.
