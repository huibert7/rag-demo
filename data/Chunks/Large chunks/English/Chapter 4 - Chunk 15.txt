Problem: Keyboard Needs to Be Serviced. If the above solutions fail to solve the keyboard problems described above, call the Apple II service center and talk to the technician. Describe the make, model, and configuration of your computer and keyboard, and then describe the probÂ­lem it is experiencing. Also tell them what you have already tried to do to find and fix the problem, and describe your results. Provide the technician with all the information you have. Don't leave out any details. Find out whether the technician has any ideas on what the problem might be. If the technician is unable to help you over the phone, find out how much of the system you should bring. You will probably only need to bring the keyboard/system unit itself. Have the technician provide an estimate as to how long the work might take, and how much it might cost. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before accepting your computer have the technician demonstrate that the problem has been repaired. Test your system after you set it up and reconnect it. Refer to Chapter 9, "The Exerciser," for instructions on burning in your system after repair.
