Chapter 7 - The Disk Drive. The previous chapters have primarily covered computer input and output; the keyboard being the major input device, and the monitor and printer being output devices. However, when you wish to do anything sophisticated with the com­puter, the facilities of one more function are needed: mass storage, as provided by the disk drive. The Apple II Plus CPU can store 48 kilobytes of information at one time. The IIe can store 64k, and the IIc provides the most memory, with 128k. This capacity is not adequate to hold software programs and all your data. Two or three application programs could easily fill this capacity, leaving no room for addi­tional software or data with which to use the programs. In addition, most microcomputers, the Apple II systems included, have a volatile memory. This means that in order for the random-access memory (RAM) chips to retain their data, power must be continuously supplied to their circuitry. Once the computer is turned off, everything that was stored in that 48, 64, or 128kB is now erased.
