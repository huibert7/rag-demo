General Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines. This book is broken down in chapters according to major computer subsys­tems. If you're having trouble with the keyboard, for example, refer to Chapter 4, "The Keyboard." The chapter describes specific preventive maintenance for the keyboard, possible keyboard problems, and steps to take in troubleshooting and repairing them. Part of this troubleshooting process includes running one of the diagnostic modules. The chapter explains how to run the diagnostic module and what results to expect. With the diagnostic modules, troubleshooting is easy and automatic. Once you run the diagnostic test and discover the source of the problem, the general repair guidelines offer suggestions on how to have the problem fixed. Many of these suggestions have you doing the repairs. Even if you are not mechanically or technically "inclined," you should have little problem trouble­ shooting and even repairing diagnosed problems on the Apple II.
