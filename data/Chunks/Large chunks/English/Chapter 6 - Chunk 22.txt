Many software applications include a program called a device driver that is established for a particular printer. A device driver is a program that recognizes a peripheral device such as a letter-quality printer. Many applications, especially word processors, need to know the printer model so that special functions such as underlining and boldface can be handled correctly. The device driver lets you specify which printer is being used, and thus can let the program communicate correctly with the printer. Refer to the user manual of the application software for more information on configuring the device driver. When you connect your printer to your Apple II, ensure that any software program that uses the printer is set up to the proper interface. This information should be provided by the user documentation: the computer system, the printer, and the software documentation are all vital for specific configuration. You may encounter other problems when setting up a new printer. Again, read the printer documentation thoroughly before installing. The software user guides can also be a good resource. Consult the printer manufacturer for further inforÂ­mation.
