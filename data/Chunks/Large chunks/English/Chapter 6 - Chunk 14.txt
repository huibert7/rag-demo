Problem: The Printer Does Not Work. There are a number of different problem situations which could cause your printer not to work. Solutions: First check that the printer is on. The printer has a power indicator light on the top or front of the chassis. If the printer's ON/OFF switch is in the ON position, but the indicator is not lit, make sure the printer is properly plugged in. If it's plugged in but still not working, try using a different electrical plug. Check whether this outlet is controlled by a light switch or a switch on the power strip. Make sure the printer is in the proper mode. Most printers have an ONLINE mode which indicates that it is ready to receive data from the computer. It might also have a LOCAL mode which allows physical manipulation of the printer: rolling the paper, preparing the printer for a different form, or adjusting the platen. To get the printer operating again, switch it back to the ONLINE mode. Check the cabling. Make sure the right kind of cable is being used for the printer, and that it is inserted into the proper receptacles, both at the printer and at the computer. Ensure that the connectors are sufficiently secured and tightened down between the printer and the printer interface port on the system unit.
