Interfacing Directly with Another Computer. If your Apple II resides in an environment in which computers are less than 50 feet apart, these computers can be hard-wired together with an interface cable to connect them together directly via their serial communication ports. This connection lets them exchange data just as they would if they were hooked up through modems. The difference is that telephone lines are not needed in a hard-wire connection because of their proxÂ­imity. When computers are hard-wired together, the speed of data being sent can be much faster. The communication parameters between the two computers must match in order for them to understand and process the information being sent and received. Hard-wiring works over distances of less than 50 feet. Communication over longer distances requires modems or signal amplifiers, because the electrical pulses diminish and are lost due to the resistance of the wire through which the signals are traveling.
