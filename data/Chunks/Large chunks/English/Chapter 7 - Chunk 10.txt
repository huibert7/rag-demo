When a save command is given, this head device magnetizes the diskette emul­sion, thereby writing new data onto the diskette. The head can also locate and sense a magnetic pattern already existing in the emulsion, thereby reading exist­ing data. The head itself never physically touches the surface of the diskette as it reads or writes. Instead, it is positioned a few microns above it on a cushion of air. Software and hardware logic position the head at the proper location for reading or writing.
