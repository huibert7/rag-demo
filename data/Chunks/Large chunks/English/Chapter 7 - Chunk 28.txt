Problem: Head Crash. The disk drive head travels microns above the surface of the diskette to read and write data. A head crash is the result of the head coming into contact with the diskette. This can happen if the head is out of adjustment, or if the disk drive has been shaken or dropped. A head crash can also be caused by trying to use a warped diskette, or by contamination on the diskette or in the drive mechanism (Fig. 7-13). Diskettes, like records and tapes, can become warped and damaged when exposed to heat, or direct sunlight. If a warped diskette is placed into the drive, it will scrape up against the head and cause a head crash. Don't try to use a warped diskette, because if it causes a head crash, the disk drive will become misadjusted, and will have to be taken in for servicing. A head crash is indicated if the system cannot read from, write to, or initialize a disk. Another indication is a grinding, scratching sound heard when a diskette is inserted into the drive. If the head crashes, the drive must be taken in for servicing. Discard any diskettes that have come into contact with the drive head after the crash.
