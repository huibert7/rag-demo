The Game Paddle Module Flowchart. Once you have determined the functions to be tested as part of the Game Paddle Diagnostic, and have worked out many of the testing details, the next step is to develop the road map for writing the actual code. This road map is drawn in the form of a flowchart: first the system flowchart, and then the program flowÂ­ chart. For the system flowchart, use the appropriate flowcharting symbols to list the general task overview, organization, and order of events to take place within the program. Create a separate system flowchart for the Game Port Option, the Tracking Test, and the Fire Button Test. Your flowcharts might look similar to the ones shown in Fig. 10-10. Based on the system flowchart, detail the program flowchart. Include all loops, inputs, branches, and any other processes needed for the program structure. Try to include the actual BASIC commands within the descriptions to help you with later coding. Have your Applesoft BASIC programming manual nearby for reference. This will help you research any specialized instructions used to access commands for the game paddle. The documentation that came with the game paddle might also contain additional useful information. Make the program flowchart as detailed as possible, to provide the most information. When finished, put the three segments of the flowchart together to form one flowchart representing the Game Paddle Diagnostic Program.
