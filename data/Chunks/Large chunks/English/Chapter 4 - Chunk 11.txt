Problem: The Keyboard Doesn't Function At All. If, after pressing the keys on the keyboard nothing displays on the screen, then the keyboard is not making contact with the CPU. The character signals are not being processed by the CPU to be displayed on the screen. Solutions: The first thing to check is whether the system unit's power light, located on the lower left of the keyboard, is illuminated. If the light is off, the system unit is not getting power. Check the electrical outlet, power strip (if applicable), wall switch (if applicable), and the building's fuse box or circuit breaker. If these are in order, check the system's power supply. This is a fairly simple procedure on the Apple IIc, because the power supply is external to the system. First, disconnect and remove the power supply and swap it with one from another IIc system. If the other system fails to power up, then buying and installing a new Apple IIc power supply will solve the problem. If you own the Apple II Plus or Apple IIe, which have internal power supplies, take the system unit to an Apple II service center and have the power supply checked. If the white keyboard light is illuminated, but the keyboard does not work, check the monitor for the standard screen prompts. These prompts, displayÂ­ ing the right bracket cursor, indicate that the computer is in Applesoft BASIC. Turn the computer off. Make sure the power supply cable is securely connected to the system. Turn the computer on again. If the screen display still does not look right, refer to Chapter 3, "The System Unit" for system unit troubleshooting procedures. If the power light is illuminated and the system prompts are displayed correctly on the screen, but the keyboard still does not work, then there is a problem with the keyboard circuitry. Take the system in for servicing.
