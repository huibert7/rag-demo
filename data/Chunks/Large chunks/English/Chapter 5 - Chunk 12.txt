If you use a computer monitor instead of a television as the video output device, note that the II Plus and IIe can only use composite-type computer monitors with an RCA phono jack. On the other hand, the IIc provides two types of video connectors: RCA as well as RGB. The video interface circuit resides on the motherboard in all Apple II systems. This circuit includes trim potentiometers for adjusting color and horizontal synchronization.
