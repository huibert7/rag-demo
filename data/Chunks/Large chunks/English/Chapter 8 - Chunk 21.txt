Protocols. The XON/XOFF protocol works in conjunction with the emulator and is set with the other communication software configuration parameters. The XON/XOFF protocol is optional. Even though the baud rates might be compatiÂ­ble, if the receiving system cannot process the data fast enough, some data could get lost. The XON/XOFF protocol places transmission on hold as needed to prevent the communication buffers from overflowing, and then turns it on again to make sure that data is completely transferred. For example, suppose the Apple II has a 128-byte communication buffer. In the process of receiving a file that might be 4,000 bytes long, for example, the communication buffer will be quickly filled. When this happens, the Apple II sends a suspend command to the other system, temporarily stopping data transfer. This suspension is the XOFF command. When the buffer is emptied through computer processing, such as displaying characters on the screen, the Apple II sends a resume command, which is XON. The transfer then continues where it left off. This process continues throughout the file in 128-byte chunks until all 4,000 bytes are successfully transferred.
