Arithmetic-Logic Section. It has been said that the computer is nothing more than a counting machine. Although this is an oversimplification when discussing overall computer functions, it is accurate when discussing the arithmetic-logic section of the CPU. The arithmetic-logic section performs all counting functions, and the counting amounts to the actual processing of data. Special circuits within the microproces­sor such as registers, accumulators, and adders, make all the required calcula­tions. Comparisons are made of one number to another for logic functions using comparers.
