As soon as you obtain (or write) a new program, immediately make a backup of it, and write-protect both copies. If one of the program diskettes wears out or encounters a defect, the backup will keep you working. Write-protecting the program diskettes will prevent accidental erasure of the programs. Keep current backups of data diskettes as well. Get into the habit of making daily or weekly backups of files, depending on how much work you do in a given time period. If a particular data file gets to a point where is is finished, and will not be· changed anymore, make a final backup and write-protect both diskettes. Having backups and write-protecting when possible protects the data from acci­dental loss from a power failure, system failure, or inadvertent overwrite.
