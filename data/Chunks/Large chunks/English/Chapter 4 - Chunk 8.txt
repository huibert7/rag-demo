Keyboard Preventive Maintenance. Preventive maintenance for the keyboard is simple and important, consisting of three items: Use a dust cover on the computer when it is not in use. Do not eat or drink near the computer. Vacuum the keyboard regularly. It is particularly important to use a dust cover on the keyboard whenever it is not being used. The key contacts can quickly become defective due to an accumula­tion of dust and dirt. Bits of food falling around the sides of the keys will work their way down under the key and interfere with the contacts, and cause keys to malfunction due to poor contact. If a drink is ever accidentally spilled into the keyboard, the keyboard will probably need to be replaced. This is particularly expensive for the Apple II systems, because replacing the keyboard means replac­ing the entire system unit.
