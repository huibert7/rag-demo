Problem: A Horizontal Tab is Not Working. If the printer seems to be unable to tab over to a certain position along the carriage, run the Horizontal Tab Test. The asterisks should print in a diagonal line across the paper, starting at position 1 . Solutions: If the tabs do not print in this diagonal line, check whether something is obstructing the platen or the print head. Often simply blowing through the print head, or pulling out a bit of paper hung up on it will solve the problem. Use compressed air or a hand-held vacuum cleaner to help unclog tight areas in the printer. If these solutions fail to take care of the problem, refer to the printer docuÂ­mentation, or contact the manufacturer.
