Documentation. Save all manuals, user guides, specifications, installation instructions, and any other technical documentation that comes with your system and its peripherals. This documentation provides the necessary specifics regarding your particular Apple II configuration. Such information becomes vital when installing and setting up a new device, or if the computer experiences a malfunction. If you have inadvertently lost or thrown out important documentation, an­ other copy can probably be obtained from your Apple II dealer or device manu­facturer. You can also check with your library or Apple II user group for docu­mentation to borrow or buy.
