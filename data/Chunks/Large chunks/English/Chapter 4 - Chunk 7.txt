Key Interpretation. After the ASCII value is generated, it is sent to a special program residing in ROM which processes all input and output functions. This program reads the ASCII value and interprets what function the key is expected to perform. If the key is to be displayed on the screen, further processing transfers its value to the character generator ROM, which converts the ASCII value into a form that can be used by the monitor. If the value represents a particular key combination, such as CTRL G, further processing in the I/O ROM causes the designated function of CTRL G to be executed.
