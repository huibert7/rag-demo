- After making the proper adjustments, if the colors still are not correct, there is a variable resistor on the motherboard that serves to optimize video color.

  Follow these steps to use this color trim pot:

  1) Turn system power off, disconnect all peripheral cables, and remove the system unit cover.
  2) Reconnect the monitor and disk drive cables.
  3) Turn system power on again. While the system is open and power is on, do not touch anything. When making adjustments, use only a non-con­ductive (plastic) tuning wand. Do not use a metal screwdriver.
  4) Load and run the System Diagnostic Program. Choose the Monitor Diagnostic, and then the Low-Resolution Color Test (refer to "Running the Monitor Diagnostic Module" later in this chapter for further in­structions).
  5) Locate the color trim variable resistor on the motherboard (Fig. 5-7).
  6) Use the tuning wand to adjust this resistor in small increments until you see satisfactory colors on the screen display.
  7) Turn the system off again and disconnect the peripheral cables.
  8) Replace the system unit cover.
  9) Connect all peripheral and power supply cables.
  10) Power up the system and run several passes of the Exerciser program (see Chapter 9, The System Exerciser) to ensure that the system is functioning properly.

Adjusting the color from inside the system unit does not affect the color and tint settings on the television or monitor itself.
