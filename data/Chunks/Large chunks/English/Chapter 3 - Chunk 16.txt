Problem: The System Unit Has No Power. If the system unit is not working at all, first check whether or not it has power. To do this, try the following solutions. Solutions: Check whether or not the system unit's power light located on the lower left of the system unit/keyboard is illuminated. If it is not lit, then the system unit is not getting power. Check the electrical outlet, the power strip if applicable, the wall switch if applicable, and the fuse box or circuit breaker. If these are all in order, the next thing to do is check the system's power supply. On the Apple IIe, this is a fairly simple procedure, because the power supply is external to the system. Remove the power supply and swap it on another Apple IIe system. If that system also fails to power up, then buying ' and installing a new power supply will solve the problem. Do not tamper with the internal power supply if you own the II Plus or IIe. Take the system unit to an Apple II service outlet and have the technician check the power supply.
