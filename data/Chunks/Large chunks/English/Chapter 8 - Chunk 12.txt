How the Serial Communication Interface Functions. Serial communication is a function of timing and speed. Several factors conÂ­tribute to keeping the communicating devices synchronized with one another so that they can interpret the data being sent. These factors include: Communication software. Data speed (baud rate). Data size. Start and stop bits. Parity. Directionality. Emulation. Protocols. Interface port.
