The first pass writes a series of 254-byte records that contain a 254-character string of CHR$ value 170. CHR$ value 64 is a character that has a bit string of 1000000. The diagnostic writes 239 records of CHR$ value 64 to fill up the disk. While the records are being written to disk, the message "WRITING HIGH VALUES TO DISK" is displayed. It takes about five minutes for the disk to be filled with these records. Once this is done, the file is closed. The diagnostic immediately begins the second pass through the disk, which consists of reopening the file and rereading the data that were written during the first pass. The read data are compared to CHR$ value 64. While the records are being read and compared, the message "READING HIGH VALUES FROM DISK" is displayed. It takes about five minutes for all the records to be read and compared.
