Problem: Nothing Displays on the Monitor. If nothing is displayed on the monitor, try the following solutions. Solutions: Make sure the monitor is turned on. Check the brightness and contrast knobs, and make sure they are turned at least two-thirds of the way up. The controls may have been turned down to prevent the screen from etching (see "Etching" above). Check that the monitor is properly connected. If the monitor is a television set plugged into a different socket than the computer, check to see whether the outlet is controlled by a light switch. If it is, make certain the light switch is turned on. Note: It's not a good idea to use a light switch controlled outlet for the computer or monitor. Someone might accidentally snap the switch off while you are using your computer, causing the system to crash and data to be lost. Make certain the electrical outlet is active and working. Test this by checking whether or not another electrical device plugged into the socket works. If it doesn't, then you have an electrical supply problem. Check the fuse box or circuit breaker. Check the cabling to ensure that the monitor is properly attached to the system unit monitor interface on the motherboard. After the monitor is properly warmed up (it takes a minute or so), turn the brightness control knob up as far as it will go. A series of lines should be displayed across the screen (Fig. 5-5). The monitor's power supply might be defective if the screen remains blank. Take the monitor in for servicing. Besides the monitor simply not working, if it's making a crackling noise, it might indicate a problem with the monitor interface. A missing cursor also indicates an interface problem. First try swapping a different monitor or television onto your system. If the new monitor works, then your monitor needs servicing. If the swapped monitor fails to work, then you might have a problem with the system unit. Refer to Chapter 3 for system unit troubleshooting procedures.
