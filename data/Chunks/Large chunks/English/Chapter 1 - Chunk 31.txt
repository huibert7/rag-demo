Food and Drink. Don't eat, drink, or smoke near your computer. For example, if you spill or drip something into the keyboard, you will have an emergency cleaning job on your hands, or the instant need for a new keyboard. Because the keyboard and system unit are included in the same housing, any liquid that spills in the keyboard could seep into the system unit, causing far more serious prob­lems such as shorting system components out and causing permanent damage. Ashes, cookie crumbs, sandwich particles, dinner bits, can all end up inside the keyboard and system unit if you smoke or eat while working. This can destroy the keyboard contacts and render the keyboard useless. It can also damage compo­nents within the system unit.
