Check that the application program is addressing the printer correctly. The printer might not be working because the correct printer driver has not been installed for the application in use. The driver is activated by a printer installation program provided with your application software. This special utility program prompts you to enter the make of printer being used so that the output to the printer is produced correctly. It also ensures that any special printing functions such as boldface and italic can be used. The printer installation program provides a wide range of popular models from which to choose. Even off-brand printers always have an equivalent to one of these choices. If you do not run the application's printer installation program, the driver might not be installed properly, which would in turn cause the printer not to work. Certain option switch settings within the printer might make it impossible to print. These switch settings control parameters such as baud rate and word length. Refer to the printer documentation for more information about these internal switch settings. For more information about terms such as baud rate and word length, refer to Chapter 8, "The Serial Communication Interface."
