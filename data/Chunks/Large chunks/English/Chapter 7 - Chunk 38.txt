Problem: Disk Drive Needs to Be Serviced. If the solutions described above fail to solve your disk drive problem, and you need to take it in for servicing, first call the Apple II service center and talk to the repair technician. Describe the computer's configuration, and explain the disk drive problems. Tell them what troubleshooting measures you have already tried, and the results. Find out if there are any solutions they can provide over the phone. If the disk drive cannot be repaired over the phone, ask the technician how much of your system you should bring. You will need to take in the disk drive and its controller board. The technician will probably also need the system unit. When you take the disk drive in, find out if the technician has any ideas on what the problem might be, and how long and how much it might cost to fix. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before you pay for and accept your disk drive and controller, have the repair technician demonstrate that the problem has actually been repaired. When the system is all together again, refer to Chapter 9, The Exerciser, for instructions on burning in the system after repair. The Exerciser has an extensive section on burning in the disk drives.
