Chapter 9 - Post-Repair Test and Burn-In. Chapters 3 through 8 have each covered individual components of the Apple II system. We have examined and treated problems that can occur within a particuÂ­lar subsystem. Chapter 9 provides a diagnostic module that tests not just a single subsystem, but rather exercises the Apple II system as a whole, testing the entire integrated computer for problems. If something goes wrong with your computer and you repair it or take it in for professional servicing, check it out thoroughly after the repair is completed. This chapter describes and provides methods for testing the repaired system to make sure everything works as it should.
