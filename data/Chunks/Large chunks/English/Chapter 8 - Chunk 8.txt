Modems can only operate in pairs. For two computers to communicate with one another, each computer must be connected to a modem that has matching configurations, including communication speed, data size, start bits, and other such parameters which will be discussed later in this chapter. Online services such as CompuServe, DELPHI, Dow Jones News, The Source, and Computext make it easy for people with computers and modems to *link up* to the network centers of information. By coupling the modem to a telephone, then dialing a specific telephone number (which is often a local or toll-free number), the Apple II can be linked into a network's mainframe computer. The network service can then be used to research a wide range of information, as well as to communicate with other users. Online services can also provide you with bank­ ing, shopping, and airline reservation services through your Apple II serial com­munication interface and modem (Fig. 8-4). The Apple II systems connect to external modems. An RS-232 modem uses the RS-232 cable, and connects to the serial port at the rear of the system unit.
