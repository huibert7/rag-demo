The daisy wheel includes the entire character set for a given font family and point size. Instead of being formed by a single print head with a series of dots, these characters are individually and solidly embossed onto the daisy wheel. A printer motor spins the daisy wheel around until the desired character spins into position, at which point the print hammer strikes the character against the ink ribbon to form the character on paper. It works on a principle similar to the typewriter, although much faster. Although the daisy wheel is the most common print element used in letterÂ­ quality printers, character thimbles and cups are used by some printers. They work in the same general manner as the daisy wheel. No matter which element is used with a letter-quality printer, they all provide the capability of printing different font families at a higher quality.
