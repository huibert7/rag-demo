Functions of the Game Paddle. The game paddle is a pointing and firing device (Fig. 10-5) used to either position an object on the screen, or to fire a graphic object, like a missile, at another graphic object, as part of a game. A jet airplane can be flown, a graphic robot can be moved, or a laser cannon can be controlled with the game paddle. The game paddle is a mechanical device which consists of a tracking wheel controlled by a potentiometer, and a fire button controlled by a switch. A cable connects it to the motherboard in one of the two game paddle sockets(Fig. l0-6). Each game paddle socket can accommodate two game paddles. This means the system can allow up to four game paddles at the same time.
