While writing the code, save the program to disk periodically, perhaps once every five or ten minutes. This will avoid the loss of valuable work in the event of a power or system failure. After you finish with a segment of the program in which a particular task is begun, processed, and completed, save the program to disk and try it out. It's easier to pinpoint simple problems this way, rather than waiting until the entire program is written to try it out. It is also encouraging and gratifying to find out instantly that the program is working as expected. When it seems like the program code is complete, and functions are working as expected, save the program and create a backup. Print out a program listing and continue to the module testing phase.
