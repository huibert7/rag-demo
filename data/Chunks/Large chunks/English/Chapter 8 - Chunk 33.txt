Once the loopback is set up on the cable pins, follow the instructions provided in "Running the Diagnostic Program" in Chapter 2. Then press S to initiate the Serial Communication Diagnostic module. The Serial Communication Test instructions will be displayed (Fig. 8- 11). At this point you are ready to run the Serial Communication Diagnostic, consisting of the Character Loopback Test. The Character Loopback Test displays a prompt to enter a character on the keyboard. This character is sent through the communication loop created by the loopback wire. The loopback causes the character to be sent back immediately and received as output displayed on the monitor screen. This checks the func­tions of the serial communication interface by both transmitting and receiving data. The ASCII value of the character is also displayed on the screen (Fig. 8- 12). This test is particularly useful for testing function keys such as the carriage return, tab key, and cursor arrows. Through the display of ASCII values on the screen, you can check whether the communication interface is sending the cor­rect codes for function keys as well as character keys.
