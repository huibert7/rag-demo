Scroll Test. To test display page scrolling, press 4 from the Monitor Diagnostic Menu. The Scroll Test prompts for the number of repetitions for the test. If you enter a number less than 35 , the program defaults to scrolling 35 lines. The test displays the same line for the specified number of repetitions in a sliding character set display on the screen. Once the screen is filled, the top line scrolls off the top of the screen and disappears, while a new line appears at the bottom of the screen. If new lines are added to the bottom, the lines of the character set appear to walk down and across the screen, shifting to the right, one character at a time. If it scrolls properly, the screen resembles Fig. 5-13.
