### Low-Resolution Color Graphics Test.

To test the low-resolution color mode, press 5 from the Monitor Diagnostic Menu. The screen displays a menu of the sixteen colors available in the low-reso­lution mode. Enter the color name exactly as it is shown in the menu, using all uppercase letters. As soon as you enter the name of the color to test, the screen is completely filled with low-resolution blocks at each location. Even if you are not using a color monitor, this is a good test for the low-resolution memory locations (Fig. 5-14).

If there are any locations that are not filled with one of the blocks, then there is a video memory problem. Also, if the selected color is not correctly represented on the screen, then there is a color adjustment problem. Leave this test displayed on the screen, make the necessary adjustments, and view all the colors until they're displaying correctly. Refer to "Problem: Colors Do Not Display Correctly" ear­lier in this chapter for the adjustment procedure.

Press any key to end the test. The screen will clear and return to the color menu, and another color can be tested if desired. When finished testing colors, press ESC, and the Monitor Diagnostic Main Menu will be displayed again.
