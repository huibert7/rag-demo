The Power Supply. The power supply provides DC (direct current) voltage to the computer. It consists of a transformer, rectifier, and filter, and also includes a cooling fan to dissipate the heat generated by the input and output voltages. The computer's power cord, which is plugged into the AC wall outlet, ensures that 115 volts of alternating current (VAC) goes from the standard electrical supply into the computer's power supply. The power supply then rectifies 115 VAC into the 5 or 12 volts direct current (VDC) required for the computer's electronic circuitry. The power supply is an external unit on the Apple IIc. On the II Plus and IIe systems, the power supply is internal, housed within the system unit (Fig. 3-4).
