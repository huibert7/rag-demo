Integrating with the System Diagnostic Program. Once the code for the Game Paddle Diagnostic is written and thoroughly tested on its own, you must integrate it with the rest of the System Diagnostic Program. First modify the System Diagnostic Main Menu routine, which displays and accesses all the diagnostic module options. Examine lines 50 through 90 of the program where the Main Menu module resides. Add the Game Paddle Diagnos­tic identifier to the `PRINT` statement that lists the menu options on the screen. Also, insert the appropriate `IF` statement for the Game Paddle Diagnostic identi­fier in lines 110-180, so that the program branches to the beginning of the Game Paddle Diagnostic module when the appropriate key, perhaps a G, is pressed. Once this is done, add the code to the program. A good place to append the new code is starting at line 6000, as was done in this chapter's example. This begins the new module where the last diagnostic module stopped.
