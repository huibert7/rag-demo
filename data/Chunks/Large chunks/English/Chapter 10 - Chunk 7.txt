Examine the troubleshooting guide as a first step to developing a new diagnos­tic module. This will familiarize you with typical problems for which the diagnostic can test. The troubleshooting guide provides information about the partic­ular device, but does not take into account the software running with the device, the hardware configuration of the system, or the type of interface. In other words, the troubleshooting guide does not know your particular system, and therefore, cannot specifically address exact troubleshooting requirements. It would be im­ possible for any troubleshooting guide to consider all these factors, simply be­ cause there are an infinite number of possibilities and combinations. Because of this, it is clear that you can gain a greater benefit from developing a customized troubleshooting diagnostic for the device as it works with your partic­ular system.
