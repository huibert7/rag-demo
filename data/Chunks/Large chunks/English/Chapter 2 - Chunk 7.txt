A sixth monitor test, the High-Resolution Color Graphics Test, is also proÂ­vided as a separate program, due to Apple II memory allocation constraints pertaining to high-resolution graphics. It checks the six colors available at each high-resolution memory location on the screen. This program is provided on the same diskette with the System Diagnostic Program, or it can be copied from the listing provided in Appendix B.
