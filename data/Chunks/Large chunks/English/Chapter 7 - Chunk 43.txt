Just as in the second pass, the fourth pass through the disk opens the file and rereads the data written during the third pass. The read data are compared to CHR$(63). The message "READING LOW VALUES FROM DISK" is disÂ­ played for approximately five minutes. The error counter is incremented if there are any discrepancies between what was written and what is now being read. Then the file is deleted, and the test is complete. Data mismatch errors are counted and a final total is displayed at the end of the test. Such errors are not fatal errors, and the test will continue. If there are 1 or 2 mismatch errors, you might want to test the drive more often, to see if it gets worse. But one or two errors do not warrant your taking action.
