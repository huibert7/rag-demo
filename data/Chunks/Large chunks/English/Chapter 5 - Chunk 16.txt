### Cleaning.

At least once a month, wipe the monitor case down with a lint-free cloth dampened with denatured isopropyl alcohol. Use a hand-held vacuum cleaner or compressed air to clean dust accumulated around the ON/OFF switch, brightness control, contrast control, and any other controls and switches on the monitor.

Clean the monitor screen with a special optical cleaner. Household glass cleaner is not always appropriate. Check the monitor documentation or a comÂ­puter retailer for screen cleaning recommendations.
