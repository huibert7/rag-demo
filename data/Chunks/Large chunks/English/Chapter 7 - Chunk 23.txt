Problem: Read Data Is Garbled. In addition to wearing out, diskettes can be damaged and the data on them garbled if not handled properly. Since diskettes are magnetic media, magnetism can adversely affect the data on a diskette. If a diskette is placed next to an unshielded power supply, or near an appliance with a motor, the motor's magÂ­netic field will confuse the data. Although the 5 1/4-inch diskette is enclosed in plastic, there is a small window at the hub of the diskette where the diskette is exposed for the drive head access. If the diskette is handled roughly, or if this exposed area is contaminated, the emulsion could be altered, and data lost.
