The modem might also have a self-test mode (check the modem documentaÂ­tion). This self-test mode loops a data pattern back through the modem. It uses a pattern of characters from the computer, sends the pattern through the modem back to itself, and then returns them to the computer. This internal loopback test checks the modem to make sure that sending and receiving is indeed taking place. Use this self-test mode if the previous steps did not establish communication. If a problem is diagnosed through the modem self-test, refer to the modem documentation for further action. A carrier is a tone that the modem expects before it can send data. It's like saying "Hello" after the phone rings and you have picked up the receiver. After saying "Hello," communication can be established, and information from the caller can be transmitted.  This carrier can be heard when using a smart modem that dials the phone automatically. First you would hear the phone ring through the modem speaker, and then a high-pitched tone would sound. This audible signal is the carrier, and it tells the system that the modem is ready to accept data, either from your system or from the other system. The CD (Carrier Detect) light is illuminated. This indicates that the other system has answered and been given the carrier. If the carrier signal is not received, it could indicate a wrong number, a busy signal, or a problem at the other end.
