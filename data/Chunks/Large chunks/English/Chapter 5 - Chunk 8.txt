When a character on the keyboard is pressed to be displayed on the monitor, or when a particular application prints processing results, the program instructs the monitor to create a certain pattern to form the character representation. The specific pattern displayed is dependent upon the type of display matrix your monitor has.

In the text mode, the monitor's display works on a character matrix. The display is divided into 24 horizontal rows which are intersected by 40 or 80 vertical columns. The position where a column and row intersect is one character location (Fig. 5-4).

The high-resolution or color display is a matrix as well, but a more detailed matrix, working at a pixel level rather than a character level. Since an individual pixel is much smaller than a character, and since there is a greater density of pixels, there is more flexibility and precision represented on the display. This creates a sharper picture with higher resolution.
