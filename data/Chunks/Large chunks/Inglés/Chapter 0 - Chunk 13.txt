The Subsystem Diagnostic Module. The System Diagnostic Program lets you gather information to determine whether the subsystem being tested has a problem, and to pinpoint where that problem lies. The "Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" indicate when a particular test should be performed. Instructions for running the module are provided in its own section, along with illustrations of expected test results. After performing these tests, you'll be able to make a diagnosis and take the appropriate action. The program listings and detailed line-by-line explanations of this program code are also included in the corresponding chapters. This is particularly useful if you know how to program in BASIC, and would like to understand the program logic. This can also help you modify the program for your own specific purposes, or create new modules for additional subsystems and peripherals. If you are not familiar with BASIC, you can easily skip these program explanaÂ­tions and still use the diagnostic modules successfully. The entire program is ready to use. Just create a backup of the program, then load it into your system.
