Several interface cables can be connected to your system unit at the rear, to provide pathways from the controller circuits to the peripheral devices. The cable connectors plugged into the system unit receptacles can work loose when a part of the system is moved. If the cable loosens enough to where it's not making the proper connection, the peripheral will stop working. Make sure that the keyboard/system unit is closed. The system unit cover attaches to the unit with interlocking plastic fasteners. Make certain these fasÂ­teners are properly snapped down, and replace them if they aren't working correctly. If the unit pops open, it can cause improper contacts while working.
