When you make adjustments on one of the printed circuit boards, use a tuning wand, which is a non-conductive screwdriver. This prevents any electrical curÂ­ rents residing in the board from being conducted into your hand and through your body. Never open the monitor, because it contains dangerous capacitors and high voltage that is stored and can be discharged through you, causing severe electrical shock. If the system has a problem that requires opening the monitor, take it in for servicing, and have a professional do it for you. Such technicians are certified in high-voltage electrical work.
