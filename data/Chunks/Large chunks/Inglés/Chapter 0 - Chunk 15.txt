Finally, Chapter 10 details the techniques used in developing diagnostic modÂ­ules for other peripheral devices, such as digitizer tablets and joysticks, not already provided for in the System Diagnostic Program. By demonstrating how the game paddle diagnostic module was developed, Chapter 10 presents a systematic diagnostic approach that starts by helping you learn how to predict problems that can occur with the device. Once you learn the types of problems that can occur, and you have the information needed to diagnose these problems, you can write a new routine appropriate to such a troubleshooting activity.
