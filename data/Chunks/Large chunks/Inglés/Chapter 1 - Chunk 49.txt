Working with IC Chips. If your troubleshooting efforts determine that a particÂ­ular IC chip is defective, you can easily replace the chip if it is socketed. IC chips are either soldered onto the board, or socketed into chip sockets. Socketed chips can easily be removed and replaced. To do this, use a chip extractor to lift the chip off of its socket (Fig. 1-7).
