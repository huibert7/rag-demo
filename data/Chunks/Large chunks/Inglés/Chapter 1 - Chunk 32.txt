Preventive Maintenance Techniques. Preventive maintenance consists of those procedures which are performed as part of periodic general system care. Preventive maintenance procedures help keep the system running properly, and prevent breakdowns. The following preÂ­ventive maintenance procedures are applicable to the system as a whole. More detailed procedures about individual subsystems are covered in the "Preventive Maintenance" section found in each subsystem chapter. These preventive maintenance procedures should be performed regularly - at least once every three months. Do them more often if the computer is situated in a harsher environment than normal.
