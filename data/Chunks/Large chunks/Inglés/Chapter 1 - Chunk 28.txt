There are several ways to protect your computer from static electricity. Spray the floor or carpet around your system with an anti-static solution. Additionally, lay down an anti-static mat under your computer. Anti-static spray as well as the mat can be obtained at an office or computer supply store. The least expensive solution is to simply touch something metal that's not part of the system, perhaps a desk lamp or file cabinet, before touching the computer. This grounds you and prevents the transfer of static electricity to the computer. Do not touch the metal edge connectors, when handling a printed circuit board within the system. This will discharge electricity in your body through the printed circuit board to the nearest IC chip.
