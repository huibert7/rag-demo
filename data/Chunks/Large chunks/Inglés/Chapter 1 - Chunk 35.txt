Disk Drive Head. The floppy disk drive head can accumulate a layer of oxidation after continued use. To remove this oxidation, use a disk drive head cleaning kit. These kits are available at most computer stores, and include a special diskette permeated with isopropyl alcohol. Follow the instructions that come with the cleaning kit. This will consist of inserting the cleaning diskette into the disk drive, and entering a command that causes the diskette to rotate. In this manner, the read/write heads are flash-cleaned.
