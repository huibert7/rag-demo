Subsystem Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines. If a problem with your computer does surface, refer to the appropriate subsysÂ­tem chapter. For example, if the printer is not working correctly, refer to Chapter 6, The Printer. Within that chapter, refer to the "Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" section. Then look up the name of the problem that fits what the system is experiencing. Follow the troubleshooting and repair instructions in the order given. This becomes the computer's treatment plan, helping you to isolate the problem and then take the appropriate action. You can often fix the problem yourselfby following these instructions. If it's a more complex problem that warrants taking your system to a computer service center, you can do so with a more in-depth explanation, a diagnosis of the problem, and a specific focus of what must be done. This saves the technician repair time, and thus saves you money.
