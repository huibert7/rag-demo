Limitations. Never try to fix something for which you do not have the proper knowledge, documentation, tools, or parts. A little knowledge on your part can be a danger­ous thing to your computer, especially when you know just enough to get into trouble and possibly make the problem worse. Never attempt any procedure you feel you cannot handle. Do easy repairs first, and work your way up to the more difficult repairs as your skill and confidence grow. When in doubt, let the professionals do it. Don't place your computer in needless jeopardy. Don't try any troubleshooting or repair procedure on a working system just because it sounds like fun and you want to experiment. If it works, don't fix it. Preventive maintenance procedures are the only procedures that should be per­formed on a well-running system.
