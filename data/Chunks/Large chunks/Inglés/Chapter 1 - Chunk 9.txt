Tools and Resources. Troubleshooting and repairing computers may seem to be a difficult task. However, most computer technicians go about their work methodically. They test various aspects of the system to gather information about the symptoms of the problem. Then they use this information to make logical deductions as to the nature of the malfunction. The system repair is effected by making adjustments and replacing faulty components. To perform such troubleshooting and repair activities, computer technicians have specific knowledge and training about the particular systems they service, as well as complete sets of pertinent documentation and schematics. Technicians use a good set of tools, and have spare parts available to them. Additionally, they have various information resources upon which to draw. Although you cannot expect to do as thorough a job as a computer technician without the same investment in training, tools, and spares, you can take cues by learning some of their basic processes and techniques. Then, when your comÂ­puter malfunctions or breaks down, you will be better prepared to analyze and then solve the problem with a minimum of effort and expense.
