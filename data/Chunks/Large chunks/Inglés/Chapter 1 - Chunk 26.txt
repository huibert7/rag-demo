In addition, dust and dirt accumulating under the keycaps of the keyboard can cause contact problems. In this case, you might press a key and have nothing happen, because there is so much dirt that the pressed key can no longer send the signal to the keyboard controller. A piece of dust inside the disk drive can cause problems there as well. The drive head travels mere microns above the surface of the diskette. If a piece of dust gets in the way of the drive head, it can cause data to be read or written incorrectly. Accumulated dust inside the printer mechanism can cause poor-quality printing. Spending $10 or $20 for a dust cover is preferable to buying a brand new printed circuit board to replace one that has been ruined by corrosion or other damage caused by dust. Get into the habit of covering the system when not in use.
