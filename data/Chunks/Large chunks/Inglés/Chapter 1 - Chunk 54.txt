Contact someone who owns an identical Apple II system, and agree to loan and borrow components when needed for troubleshooting. Start establish­ing your computer user resources. Try out the diagnostics now, before you encounter a problem. Know how the results are supposed to appear under normal circumstances. Code any necessary modifications into the System Diagnostic Program. These modifications might have to do with accommodating another periph­eral, or a different kind of system, printer, or keyboard than what is allowed in this program. Test the modified program thoroughly, and when satisfied that the program is working as it should, make a backup copy. If you follow the measures listed above, you'll be ready to troubleshoot and repair at the first sign of a suspected computer malfunction.
