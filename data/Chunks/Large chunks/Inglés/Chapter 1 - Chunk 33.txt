Vacuum/Compressed Air. Use a hand-held vacuum cleaner or can of com­ pressed air (like camera lens cleaner), to vacuum or blow around components such as the keyboard keys (Fig. 1-4), and printer mechanism. Also, open the system unit cover and carefully vacuum or blow around the inside of the com­puter. This clears out any dust and dirt that works its way into the system in spite of the dust cover. If you have a choice between the two, it's preferable to vacuum dust up rather than blow it around. Blowing dust can possibly send it deeper into the system where it could cause even more trouble.
