The PC board can be removed once all the cables are disconnected. Hold it by its edges and gently rock the board out of its edge connector. Take care not to touch the underside of the board with its exposed IC pins, which could cut your fingers. Also, don't touch the metal edge connector. You could transfer electrical charges through all the circuits on the board and damage them. When installing the board back into its edge connector, align it in place, then hold it by its edges and push it gently into the connector until it is firmly seated. Remember, never force anything.
