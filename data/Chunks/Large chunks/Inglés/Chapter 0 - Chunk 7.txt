Maintenance and repair techniques. Chapter 1 covers general computer maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair techniques. It provides the foundation necessary to make use of the specific procedures and instructions found in the subsequent subsystem chapters under the "Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" sections. The repairs described in Chapter 1, as well as in the later subsystem chapters, do not require knowledge or expertise in electronics. You do not need to know how to solder, nor do you need to know how to troubleshoot a series of integrated circuit chips. This book details the steps necessary for diagnosing a problem, and once this is done, for effecting a repair. You are even given suggestions as to when the repair of a subassembly should not be attempted, and when it should be taken in for professional servicing.
