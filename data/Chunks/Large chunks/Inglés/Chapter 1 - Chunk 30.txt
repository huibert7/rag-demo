Because boards are expensive to repair and many chips are expensive to replace, and because your work and your time are valuable, protect the computer from these indiscriminate voltage surges by using a surge protector, which isolates the voltage surges and spikes in order to provide the system with a constant 110/120-volt supply. You can buy a surge protector at a computer or electronics supply store. Connect the AC cord into the surge protector, and plug the surge protector into the AC outlet. Many power strips have built-in surge protectors as well. Using a surge protector with the computer will extend the life of its inteÂ­grated circuits, and will also prevent loss of data while you're working.
