When replacing screws, do not force them into their holes. Turn the screw gently in its hole and wait until you feel the threads engage before tightening it down. If the screw should go in at an angle, and you force the screw in, this strips the screw threads, making the screw and its hole useless. Never force anything when removing or replacing any part of the system. If the item is in its proper place, force is not necessary and will only cause damage.
