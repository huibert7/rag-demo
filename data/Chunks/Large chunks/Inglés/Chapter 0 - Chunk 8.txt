The System Diagnostics program. The System Diagnostic Program provided with this book assists in troubleÂ­ shooting. This BASIC program includes eight modules, each designed to perform a series of tests on a different component or aspect of the system. The modules that make up the System Diagnostic Program are as follows: Main Menu Module. Keyboard Module. Monitor Module. Printer Module. Disk Drive Module. Serial Communication Interface Module. The System Exerciser Module. The Game Paddle Module. You can buy the program on a diskette (refer to the last page of this book), or you can key it in yourself (refer to the Appendix). Chapter 2 explains how to load and run this program. In addition, the Main Menu module is explained, just as the subsystem modules are explained in subsequent chapters. A brief overview of the Applesoft BASIC commands used in the System Diagnostic Program is also included.
