Getting Started. To get going on general care of the Apple II system, preventive maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair, do the following: Read through this book to become familiar with the concepts and organiza­tion of the material. This way you can get started immediately with preven­tive maintenance, and when a problem arises, you'll know right where to look. Make a backup of the System Diagnostic Program. If you did not purchase the program diskette, key in all the diagnostic programs now, before any problems arise. Then if something does go wrong, you'll already be prepared to troubleshoot. Gather the basic tools and cleaning supplies into a computer maintenance kit. Collect all technical documentation and find a central place for it, perhaps an area at your desk or bookcase, or in a binder.
