Replacing Subassemblies. When you suspect that a particular subsystem of the computer needs to be replaced, first swap the component with that of another system. This will confirm that the component really is defective, and that it is not a problem elsewhere in the system. When you confirm that a subassembly must be replaced, take it with you to the computer dealer or electronics supply store. This will help you get an exact replacement. You can also find out if the store has a trade-in allowance for the old part. If the component is broken beyond repair, you might find it interesting to take it apart. There is nothing to lose at this point, so you can fool with it and find out how it ticks. This way, if the replacement component ever has a problem, you'll have a better idea of what to do with it, without the fear of damaging it further.
