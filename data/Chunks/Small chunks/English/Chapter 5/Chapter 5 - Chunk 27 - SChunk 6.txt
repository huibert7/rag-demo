Once the television broadcast picture displays the correct colors, switch the television back to the computer mode and check the color. It's possible that the color of a television broadcast might look fine, but when working in the computer mode, the colors are wrong and/or fuzzy. When working with a computer monitor, simply adjust the color and tint controls of the moniÂ­tor, just as you would with a television.
