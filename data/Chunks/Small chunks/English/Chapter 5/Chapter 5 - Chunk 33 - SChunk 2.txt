To test the low-resolution color mode, press 5 from the Monitor Diagnostic Menu. The screen displays a menu of the sixteen colors available in the low-resoÂ­lution mode. Enter the color name exactly as it is shown in the menu, using all uppercase letters. As soon as you enter the name of the color to test, the screen is completely filled with low-resolution blocks at each location. Even if you are not using a color monitor, this is a good test for the low-resolution memory locations.
