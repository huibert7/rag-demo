Some software programs utilize the high­ resolution graphics mode, which illuminates every speck of light, or pixel picture element, in different combinations to form pictures. These pixels allow the cre­ation and display of computer drawings and graphics on the screen. The greater the number of pixels, the better the screen resolution. The better the screen resolution, the sharper the displayed image.
