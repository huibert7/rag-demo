If any part of the screen is blank instead of filled, then there is a problem with the high-resolution memory locations as controlled by one of the RAM chips. Each RAM chip is labeled RAM beside its socket on the floor of the motherboard. Unplug your system, open it up, and carefully remove one of the RAMs using a chip extractor (refer to "Working with IC Chips" in Chapter 1 ). Take the chip to an electronics supply store and buy one or two exact replacements. Replace the new RAM in the original socket, and check if the problem is still present.
