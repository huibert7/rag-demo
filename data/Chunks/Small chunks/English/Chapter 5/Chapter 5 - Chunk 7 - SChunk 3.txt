A special matrix of these light spots are the dots that form each of the characÂ­ters. On a monochrome monitor, about seven of these light spots positioned in a certain manner make up one character. On a high-resolution monitor, these light spots are the pixels which can densely form the characters, graphic elements, and drawings. The series of dots used to build characters is called the dot matrix.
