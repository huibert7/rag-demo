Use the tuning wand (do not use a metal screwdriver) to gently turn the Horizontal and Vertical potentiometers ("pots") either clockwise or counÂ­terclockwise to bring the screen back into alignment. Note the direction you're turning the pot, and turn only one-quarter turn at a time, so you can easily return the pot to its original position if you over-adjust.
