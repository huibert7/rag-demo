When you press 1, you are prompted to enter the number of lines you wish to run. If you enter a number less than 35, the program defaults to running 35 scrolling lines. The printer begins printing a sliding alpha pattern. It types a line full of as many different characters of the character set as will fit on a line. It then feeds up another line, slides one character to the left, and prints the line of characters. The program continues to do this for the specified number of lines.
