Before you pay for and accept your disk drive and controller, have the repair technician demonstrate that the problem has actually been repaired. When the system is all together again, refer to Chapter 9, The Exerciser, for instructions on burning in the system after repair. The Exerciser has an extensive section on burning in the disk drives.
