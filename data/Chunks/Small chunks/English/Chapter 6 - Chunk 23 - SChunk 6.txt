Before you pay for and accept your printer, have the repair technician demonÂ­strate that the problem has actually been fixed. Then pack the printer up and take it home. Connect everything together, and refer to Chapter 9, "The Exerciser," for instructions on burning in the system after repair. The Exerciser includes several tests for the printer which can be run continuously.
