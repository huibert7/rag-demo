Make sure the printer is in the proper mode. Most printers have an ONLINE mode which indicates that it is ready to receive data from the computer. It might also have a LOCAL mode which allows physical manipulation of the printer: rolling the paper, preparing the printer for a different form, or adjusting the platen. To get the printer operating again, switch it back to the ONLINE mode.
