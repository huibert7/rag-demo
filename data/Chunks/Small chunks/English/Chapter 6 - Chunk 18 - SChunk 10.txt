If you suspect that the printer is inserting extra spaces between lines, run the Sliding Alpha Test of the Printer Diagnostic. The output should appear single-spaced. If there are blank line spaces in between the printed lines, there may be a faulty option switch setting that's causing the extra line feeds. Check the printer documentation for more information about switch settings.
