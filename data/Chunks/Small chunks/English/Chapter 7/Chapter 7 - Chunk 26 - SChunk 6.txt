If the other system worked with your drive controller, then you have a faulty disk drive. Swap the drive on another system. If your drive does not work, it is defective, and should be taken to an Apple II service outlet for further troubleshooting and repair. If your drive does work on another system, and you have already checked out the drive controller, then you have a problem with the motherboard.
