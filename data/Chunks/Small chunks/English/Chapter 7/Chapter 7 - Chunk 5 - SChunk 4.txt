Among these components were the disk drive and diskette. Soon the 5 1/4-inch mini-floppy diskette with its 5 1/4-inch disk drive became the standard. There are even micro-floppies, at 3 1/2 inches. These diskettes are smaller and easier to use than the 8-inch versions. The Apple II systems use 5 1/4-inch floppy diskettes.
