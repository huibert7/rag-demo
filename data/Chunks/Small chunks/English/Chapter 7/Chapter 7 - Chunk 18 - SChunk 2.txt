The diskettes themselves also require special care and handling. Often what might appear to be a disk drive or controller problem is nothing more than a media problem that could have been prevented. When not in use, store each diskette in a diskette envelope, and place all your diskettes in a diskette box or case. This prevents dust and dirt from gathering on the diskette, and also protects the diskette from damage by heat or magnetic fields.
