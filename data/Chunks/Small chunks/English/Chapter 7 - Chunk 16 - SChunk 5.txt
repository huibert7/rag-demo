Purchase a disk drive head cleaning kit from a computer store, and clean the drive head at least once a month. Follow the instructions that come with the cleaning kit. Often these kits are supplied with a short program that positions the head over the cleaning diskette. The head is cleaned as the IPA impregnated cleaning diskette flashes off any material that might have accumulated on it.
