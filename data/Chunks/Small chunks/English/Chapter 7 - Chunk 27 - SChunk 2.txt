If a large number of data mismatch errors are encountered when you run the Disk Drive Diagnostic module as indicated by the "THERE WERE X ERRORS ENCOUNTERED DURING TEST" message displayed at the end of the test, this means that the records that were written by the test do not match with the records that were read. This points to a problem with the read/write circuitry in the drive controller.
