Whether the data is unidirectional or bidirectional depends on the type of device the data is sending to as well as the software being used for the communica­tion transfer. Some system configuration parameters in the support software might need to be set. There might also be switches to set on the serial communica­tion interface board. This would be detailed in the device documentation.
