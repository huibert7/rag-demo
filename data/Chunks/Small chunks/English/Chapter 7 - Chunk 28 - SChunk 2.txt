The disk drive head travels microns above the surface of the diskette to read and write data. A head crash is the result of the head coming into contact with the diskette. This can happen if the head is out of adjustment, or if the disk drive has been shaken or dropped. A head crash can also be caused by trying to use a warped diskette, or by contamination on the diskette or in the drive mechanism.
