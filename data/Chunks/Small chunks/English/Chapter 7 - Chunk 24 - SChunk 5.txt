A diskette is made to work on your particular computer by inserting the diskette into the disk drive and running the operating system's initializaÂ­tion program, which for the Apple II is the INIT command. This must be done to all new diskettes in order for them to work with your computer. The initialization format program places operating system information and a disk directory program onto the new diskette.
