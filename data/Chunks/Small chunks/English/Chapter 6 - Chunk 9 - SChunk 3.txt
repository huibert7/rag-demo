Although the daisy wheel is the most common print element used in letterÂ­ quality printers, character thimbles and cups are used by some printers. They work in the same general manner as the daisy wheel. No matter which element is used with a letter-quality printer, they all provide the capability of printing different font families at a higher quality.
