The printer is physically connected, or interfaced, to the Apple II system through an optional serial interface board. A parallel interface board is also available. The interface board is plugged into one of the expansion slots on the motherboard, and includes a receptacle that is exposed at the rear of the system unit to accept the printer cable.
