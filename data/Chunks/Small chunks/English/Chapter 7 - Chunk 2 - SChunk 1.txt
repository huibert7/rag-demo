To provide an unlimited storage capacity, and to prevent the loss of valuable programs and data, the floppy diskette drive is used. The disk drive provides the additional storage necessary to supplement system memory. When you comÂ­mand the computer to save a file, the program currently in system memory is written onto the diskette. The file is written in digital form, as a series of ON and OFF bits, or 1s and 0s.
