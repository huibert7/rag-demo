Once the program is loaded, the screen displays the System Diagnostic Main Menu. This menu presents several diagnostic options, as shown. A selection is made by pressing the one-character command representing the first letter of the name of the desired test. For example, if you wish to run the keyboard test, enter a K or k. The program is not character case-sensitive, but the Apple II Plus can only use the uppercase values.
