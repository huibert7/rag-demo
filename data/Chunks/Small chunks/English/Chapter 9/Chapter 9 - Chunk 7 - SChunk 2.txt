Refer to "Running the System Exerciser" later in this chapter, and run the Exerciser module. This will thoroughly burn in the new or recently repaired computer as an entire system working together. Run all functions: the monitor, printer, and disk drives for at least three cycles. Let the monitor and disk drive portions of the Exerciser run for about 12 hours. Occasionally observe the results of the burn-in to see whether any errors have occurred.
