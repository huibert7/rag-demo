If the printer is included in the Exerciser, the printer tests begin upon compleÂ­tion of the monitor testing. In total, 35 repetitions of the Sliding Alpha Test are printed. It runs through the Character Set Print Test, and then prints a line of Es for the Echo Character Print Test. The Horizontal Tab Test, and finally the Line Space Test are run, providing you with a thorough printer test.
