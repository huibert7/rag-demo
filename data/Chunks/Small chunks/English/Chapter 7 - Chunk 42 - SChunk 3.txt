The third pass recreates the file, this time with a series of 254-character records of CHR$ value 63, which has a bit string of 00011111 , opposite of the CHR$ value 64 done in the previous pass. The diagnostic writes 239 records of this value to fill the disk again. The message "WRITING LOW VALUES TO DISK" is displayed for approximately five minutes.
