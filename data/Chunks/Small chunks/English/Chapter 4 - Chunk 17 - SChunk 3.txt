If a character other than the one pressed is displayed, or if no ASCII code value is displayed, then the first troubleshooting step has been accomplished: there is something wrong with the keyboard. Refer to "Troubleshooting and Repair Guidelines" earlier in this chapter to get the keyboard working properly again. After testing is completed, press the ESC key to return the program to the System Diagnostic Main Menu.
