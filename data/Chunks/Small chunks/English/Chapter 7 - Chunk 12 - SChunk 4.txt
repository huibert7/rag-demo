The diskette, like a phonograph record or a compact laser disk, stores specific information in specific areas. For example, just as the phonograph record stores different songs on different tracks, a diskette stores information on various tracks and sectors. The diskette is divided into a series of concentric circles, with each circle being one track. There are 35 tracks on the Apple II 143-kilobyte disk drive.
