The game paddle is a mechanical device which consists of a tracking wheel controlled by a potentiometer, and a fire button controlled by a switch. A cable connects it to the motherboard in one of the two game paddle sockets. Each game paddle socket can accommodate two game paddles. This means the system can allow up to four game paddles at the same time.
