After you finish with a segment of the program in which a particular task is begun, processed, and completed, save the program to disk and try it out. It's easier to pinpoint simple problems this way, rather than waiting until the entire program is written to try it out. It is also encouraging and gratifying to find out instantly that the program is working as expected.
