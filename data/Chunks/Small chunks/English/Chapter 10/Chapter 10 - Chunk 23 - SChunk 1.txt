When you feel that the program is thoroughly tested and edited, and that it can withstand any condition without a bug cropping up, hand the program over to someone else for testing. It is a general rule that the programmer cannot thor­oughly test his own program. In fact, professional software development compa­nies often have a separate testing or quality assurance group, whose sole function is to test software after coding is complete.
