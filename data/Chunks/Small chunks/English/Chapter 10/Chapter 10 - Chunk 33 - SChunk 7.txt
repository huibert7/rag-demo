If the game paddle does not work on the other system, then you have a faulty game paddle. Spray the potentiometer wheel with contact cleaner. If necessary, follow the instructions in the game paddle user guide to open it up, and then spray the underside of the potentiometer wheel and the fire button switch with contact cleaner.
