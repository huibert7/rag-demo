The position of the wheel can be determined by the `PDL` BASIC instruction, which returns a value from 0 (exÂ­treme left) t o 255 (extreme right) . This value can be used to arithmetically derive a value between 1 and 40, representing the number of columns on a low-resolution graphics screen display. The derived value can then be used for positioning the indicator block along the diagnostic gauge.
