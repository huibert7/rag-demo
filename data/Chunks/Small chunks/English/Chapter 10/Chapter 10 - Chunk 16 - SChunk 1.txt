If the system flowchart includes a step which you do not know how to translate into the program flowchart, some additional research will be needed. Refer to a BASIC manual, the Applesoft BASIC reference guide, and the device manual for further information on how to program for a particular task. Include details of your research results in the flowchart, so it will not be necessary to look it up again when it is time for the coding stage.
