First, check your television. Switch the RF converter to the TV mode, or disconnect it altogether. Set the television channel selector to a known working television station. For example, if channel 2 television broadcasts are usually received in your area, switch it to channel 2. If channel 2 does not come in, nor does any other channel, this indicates a problem with the television's tuning or receiving circuitry, and it should be taken to a televiÂ­sion repair shop for servicing.
