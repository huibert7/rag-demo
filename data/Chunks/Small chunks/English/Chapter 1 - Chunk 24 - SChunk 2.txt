Make sure that the keyboard/system unit is closed. The system unit cover attaches to the unit with interlocking plastic fasteners. Make certain these fasÂ­teners are properly snapped down, and replace them if they aren't working correctly. If the unit pops open, it can cause improper contacts while working.
