The Apple IIc uses the 65C02 microprocessor with 128 kilobytes of memory. The IIc is contained in a different housing than the II Plus and IIe systems. The case itself is smaller and more compact. There are two serial I/O ports for a printer and modem, a mouse interface, and two disk drive controllers: one for an internal drive, and one for an external drive.
