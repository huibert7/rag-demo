The Keyboard Diagnostic module also displays the key's ASCII value, letting you check whether the keys are sending the proper code to the computer to display the proper text character, graphic symbol, special characÂ­ter, or function. The Apple II Reference Manual, provided with your Apple II system, includes a table that shows which key and/or function each ASCII value is supposed to provide.
