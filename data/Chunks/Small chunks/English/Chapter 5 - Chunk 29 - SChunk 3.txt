If the monitor cannot be repaired over the phone, ask the technician if you should bring in just the monitor, or if the system unit should be brought in as well. After supplying all available information about the monitor malfunction, find out if the technician has any ideas yet on what the problem might be, and how long and how much it might cost to fix. Be sure to get a copy of the work order. Before you pay for and accept your monitor, have the repair technician demonstrate that the problem has actually been fixed.
