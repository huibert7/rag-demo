If the problem cannot be repaired over the phone, ask the technician how much of the system you should bring to the shop. In the case of the system unit, you will probably have to take the entire system in, including monitor, interfaces, printer, game paddle, and everything else that is hooked up to the computer while it is experiencing the problem. The technician will need to look at the system as a whole.
