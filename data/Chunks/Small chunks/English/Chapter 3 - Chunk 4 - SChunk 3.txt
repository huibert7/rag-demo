The arithmetic-logic section performs all counting functions, and the counting amounts to the actual processing of data. Special circuits within the microproces­sor such as *registers*, *accumulators*, and *adders*, make all the required calcula­tions. Comparisons are made of one number to another for logic functions using *comparers*.
