Find out whether the technician has any ideas on what the problem might be. If the technician is unable to help you over the phone, find out how much of the system you should bring. You will probably only need to bring the keyboard/system unit itself. Have the technician provide an estimate as to how long the work might take, and how much it might cost. Be sure to get a copy of the work order.
