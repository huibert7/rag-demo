The monitor consists of a cathode ray tube, power supply, and the contrast, brightness, and vertical/horizontal hold adjustments. The CRT is a large vacuum tube with a display area similar to a television screen. An electron gun inside the vacuum tube collects, focuses, and emits an electron beam for controlled contact on the back of the picture tube, which is coated with phosphors. As the electrons strike the phosphor atoms, the atoms begin to glow. This reaction forms a small, clearly defined light spot.
