A particular dot-matrix printer problem is that while all the characters print, they do not print completely. In this case, it would not be just one or two individual characters that have this problem, but the entire character set. Only part of the "a", "r", or "m", might be displayed, and the same segment of the character is missing in each of the characters, for example, upper left, or lower right.
