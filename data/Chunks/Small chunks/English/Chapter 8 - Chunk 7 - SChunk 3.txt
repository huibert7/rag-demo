The word modem is derived from the term MODulator-DEModulator. The computer produces data and control signals in the form of electrical impulses of +5 volts, or 0 volts. These impulses are either ON or OFF, respectively. When the signal is ON, it is interpreted as a 1 bit. When the signal is OFF, it is interpreted as a 0 bit. All the information existing in computer programs and data is held in a series of 1s and 0s, or digital signals.
