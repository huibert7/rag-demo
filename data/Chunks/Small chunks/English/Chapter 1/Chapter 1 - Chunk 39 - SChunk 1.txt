If the power and cabling are in order, then try swapping the malfunctioning subsystem with one you know is working. First try another subsystem on your computer. If it works, then you know that your subsystem is defective. If it does not work, this probably indicates a problem with your system unit. To doubleÂ­ check this, try your malfunctioning subsystem on another system unit. If it works, this confirms a problem with your system unit.
