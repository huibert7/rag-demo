Several interface cables can be connected to your system unit at the rear, to provide pathways from the controller circuits to the peripheral devices. The cable connectors plugged into the system unit receptacles can work loose when a part of the system is moved. If the cable loosens enough to where it's not making the proper connection, the peripheral will stop working.
