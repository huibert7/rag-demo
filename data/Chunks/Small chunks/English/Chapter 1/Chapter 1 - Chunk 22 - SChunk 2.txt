Never open the monitor, because it contains dangerous capacitors and high voltage that is stored and can be discharged through you, causing severe electrical shock. If the system has a problem that requires opening the monitor, take it in for servicing, and have a professional do it for you. Such technicians are certified in high-voltage electrical work.
