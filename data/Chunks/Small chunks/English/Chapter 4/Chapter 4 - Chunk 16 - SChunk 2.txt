The Keyboard Diagnostic module consists of the Echo Key Test. This test displays, or echos, any key pressed on the keyboard along with its ASCII value. If you press a special character or key combination, the name of the character or combination is displayed, along with its ASCII value. Run the Keyboard Diagnostic module, and then press a key. This test will read and displays the key, and let you check whether or not it, or even the entire keyboard, is working.
