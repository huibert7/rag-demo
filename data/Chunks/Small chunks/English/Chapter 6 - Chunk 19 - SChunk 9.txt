If this is true, the physical character position on the daisy wheel or cup has broken off its stem. Daisy wheels and cups are fragile, and characters can break off. Remove the daisy wheel and examine it to confirm that it is indeed damaged. Buy a new daisy wheel to replace the broken one. It's a good practice to keep at least one backup daisy wheel on hand.
