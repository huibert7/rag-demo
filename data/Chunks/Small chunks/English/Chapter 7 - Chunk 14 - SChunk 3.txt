The head is positioned over the proper track and sector as directed by the drive controller. The tiny magnetic fields stored in the diskette emulsion at that locaÂ­tion induce electrical impulses into the drive head, allowing the head to copy the data from the sector and transfer it to a disk buffer in system memory. At that point, the data can be used as directed by the program and the user.
