In the case of a letter-quality printer, the daisy wheel is limited in size and can usually only accommodate about 100 upper- and lowercase characters. Because of this, it is likely that the daisy wheel does not include any special graphics characters. (However, special graphics daisy wheels are available which include such characters as part of their character sets. Consult the printer manufacturer or a printer retail outlet.)
