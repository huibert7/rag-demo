Running the Disk Drive Diagnostic takes approximately 20 minutes, with five minutes per pass through the disk. If you wish to halt the program during this test, press CTRL C. The System Diagnostic Program will be halted, and the Applesoft BASIC environment will be displayed. Depending on when the program was halted, the "TEST" file might still be on the test diskette, and you might wish to delete it.
