Online services such as CompuServe, DELPHI, Dow Jones News, The Source, and Computext make it easy for people with computers and modems to *link up* to the network centers of information. By coupling the modem to a telephone, then dialing a specific telephone number (which is often a local or toll-free number), the Apple II can be linked into a network's mainframe computer.
