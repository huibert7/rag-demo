Higher speed communication in the range of 4800 and 9600 baud is available, but is used primarily for communicating with devices that are hard-wired to a system through an interface cable. A hard-wire interface does not require an intermediary such as a modem in order to establish communication. A printer or computer that is hard-wired to another computer is able to operate at the faster speeds.
