When the modem is properly cabled into the Apple II, and the communication software is being run, the lights over TR (Terminal Ready) and DSR (Data Set Ready) should be illuminated. These lights indicate that the computer and modem are ready and that the interface signals are turned on and ready to communicate with one another. If these indicator lights are not on, there may be a problem with the interface cable connection or with the modem.
