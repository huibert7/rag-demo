The modem might also have a self-test mode (check the modem documentaÂ­tion). This self-test mode loops a data pattern back through the modem. It uses a pattern of characters from the computer, sends the pattern through the modem back to itself, and then returns them to the computer. This internal loopback test checks the modem to make sure that sending and receiving is indeed taking place. Use this self-test mode if the previous steps did not establish communication. If a problem is diagnosed through the modem self-test, refer to the modem documentation for further action.
