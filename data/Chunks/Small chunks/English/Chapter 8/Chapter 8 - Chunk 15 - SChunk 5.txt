In the same way, eight bits of data traveling at 2400 baud are transmitted and received at a much faster rate than the same eight bits traveling at 300 baud. When the baud rate is set to a predetermined speed of which both devices are aware, the system knows how long each ON bit lasts, and how long each OFF bit lasts. A typical communication interface for the Apple II has a baud rate of 300 or 1200.
