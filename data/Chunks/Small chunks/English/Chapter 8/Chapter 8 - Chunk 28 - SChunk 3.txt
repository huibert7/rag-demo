A carrier is a tone that the modem expects before it can send data. It's like saying "Hello" after the phone rings and you have picked up the receiver. After saying "Hello," communication can be established, and information from the caller can be transmitted.  This carrier can be heard when using a smart modem that dials the phone automatically. First you would hear the phone ring through the modem speaker, and then a high-pitched tone would sound.
