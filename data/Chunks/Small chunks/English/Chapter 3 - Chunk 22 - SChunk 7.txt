Before you pay for and accept your computer, have the repair technician hook everything up and demonstrate that the problem has actually been fixed and your computer is working properly. If you're satisfied, then pack the system up and take it home. Set your system up again and refer to Chapter 9, "The Exerciser," for instructions on burning in the system after repair.
