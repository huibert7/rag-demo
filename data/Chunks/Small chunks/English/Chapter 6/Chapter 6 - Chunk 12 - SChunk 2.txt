Protect the printer with a dust cover whenever it is not being used. Once a month, use a hand-held vacuum cleaner or compressed air to vacuum or blow around the printer mechanism. This removes any dust and dirt that might have accumulated. It also removes the paper and ink particles created during printing. Make sure the printer power is off before cleaning.
