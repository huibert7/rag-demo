Press 4 to run the Horizontal Tab Test. The printer prints an asterisk at column 1, feeds a line, tabs to column 2, prints an asterisk, feeds a line, tabs to column 3, prints an asterisk, and so on all the way through to column 80. In this way, every horizontal tab position is checked. The printed result is a diagonal line of asterisks running from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner of the paper.
