Most computer dimension terminology is measured in terms of bytes, particularly the amount of data that can be stored in system memory. A kilobyte is 1024 bytes. When a computer is referred to as a 128-kilobyte machine, this indicates that its system memory can store approximately 131,000 bytes at one time. The Apple lie is such a computer.
