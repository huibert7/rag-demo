The Echo Character Print Test prints, or echos, an entered character across all 80 or 132 columns of the printer. This test ensures that a certain character is printing, and if it is, it lets you check its appearance, making sure it's a complete character, and that it's not broken or faded. This test also lets you check whether all columns along the printer carriage are accepting characters.
