Using the game paddle as an example, this chapter will demonstrate and explain how to research and identify the basic functions of a new device, as well as the types of problems you might experience using it. This information will then lead you to determine the kinds of tests necessary for an effective diagnostic module. Flowcharting and coding advice will be provided, along with integration and testing procedures.
