Have the service technician describe what was done, explain why it was done, and demonstrate that the problem is now fixed as a result. However, keep in mind that even while checking the components at the repair shop, not all system functions can be checked. The technician will probably run through just a few tests for the specific problem, demonstrating that the particular component is working correctly.
